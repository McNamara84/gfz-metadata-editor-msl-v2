These platforms are built on concrete and/or steel legs anchored directly onto the seabed, supporting a deck with space for drilling rigs, production facilities and crew quarters. Such platforms are, by virtue of their immobility, designed for very long-term use. Various types of structure are used, steel jacket, concrete caisson, floating steel and even floating concrete. Steel jackets are vertical sections made of tubular steel members, and are usually piled into the seabed. Concrete caisson structures, pioneered by the Condeep concept, often have in-built oil storage in tanks below the sea surface and these tanks were often used as a flotation capability, allowing them to be built close to shore (Norwegian fjords and Scottish firths are popular because they are sheltered and deep enough) and then floated to their final position where they are sunk to the seabed. Fixed platforms are economically feasible for installation in water depths up to about 500 feet (150 m); for deeper depths a floating production system, or a subsea pipeline to land or to shallower water depths for processing, would usually be considered.",

It is a prototype of a cabled deep-sea multiparameter observatory and the first one operating with real-time data transmission in Europe since 2005. NEMO-SN1 is also the first-established node of the European Multidisciplinary Seafloor Observatory (EMSO), one of the incoming European large-scale research infrastructures included in the Roadmap of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) since 2006. EMSO will specifically address long-term monitoring of environmental processes related to marine ecosystems, climate change, and geohazards. NEMO-SN1 has been deployed and developed over the last decade thanks to Italian funding and to the European Commission (EC) project European Seas Observatory NETwork\u2014Network of Excellence (ESONET-NoE, 2007\u20132011) that funded the Listening to the Deep Ocean\u2014Demonstration Mission (LIDO-DM) and a technological interoperability test (http://www.esonet-emso.org). NEMO-SN1 is performing geophysical and environmental long-term monitoring by acquiring seismological, geomagnetic, gravimetric, accelerometric, physico-oceanographic, hydroacoustic, and bioacoustic measurements. Scientific objectives include studying seismic signals, tsunami generation and warnings, its hydroacoustic precursors, and ambient noise characterization in terms of marine mammal sounds, environmental and anthropogenic sources. NEMO-SN1 is also an important test site for the construction of the Kilometre-Cube Underwater Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT), another large-scale research infrastructure included in the ESFRI Roadmap based on a large volume neutrino telescope. The description of the observatory and its most recent implementations is presented. On June 9, 2012, NEMO-SN1 was successfully deployed and is working in real time.",

The development of C-MAN was in response to a need to maintain meteorological observations in U. S. coastal areas. Such observations, which had been made previously by USCG personnel, would have been lost as many USCG navigational aids were automated under the Lighthouse Automation and Modernization Program (LAMPS). In all, approximately 60 stations make up C-MAN.\n\nC-MAN stations have been installed on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms (see the NDBC station location map for all station locations).\n\nC-MAN station data typically include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are designed to also measure sea water temperature, water level, waves, relative humidity, precipitation, and visibility. These data are processed and transmitted hourly to users in a manner almost identical to moored buoy data. In addition to the conventional method of data transmission, certain C-MAN stations are equipped with telephone modems that allow more frequent data acquisition, data quality checking, and remote payload reconfiguration or restarting.",

Special-purpose buoys are designed for a variety of uses; they include cable buoys, anchor buoys, or race buoys. A mooring buoy differs from other types in not being an aid to navigation but a point to which vessels may be tied up. Secured to a permanent group of anchors by a heavy chain, such a buoy serves as a connecting link between the vessel and the anchors. The use of mooring buoys conserves space in crowded harbours because a moored vessel requires less room to swing with the wind and tide than does a vessel at anchor.",

They are deployed in the coastal and offshore waters from the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the Bering Sea to the South Pacific. NDBC's moored buoys measure and transmit barometric pressure; wind direction, speed, and gust; air and sea temperature; and wave energy spectra from which significant wave height, dominant wave period, and average wave period are derived. Even the direction of wave propagation is measured on many moored buoys.\n\nNDBC's fleet of moored buoys includes 6 types: 3-m, 10-m, and 12-m discus hulls; 6-m boat-shaped (NOMAD) hulls; and the newest, the Coastal Buoy and the Coastal Oceanographic Line-of-Sight (COLOS) buoy. The choice of hull type used usually depends on its intended deployment location and measurement requirements. To assure optimum performance, a specific mooring design is produced based on hull type, location, and water depth. For example, a smaller buoy in shallow coastal waters may be moored using an all-chain mooring. On the other hand, a large discus buoy deployed in the deep ocean may require a combination of chain, nylon, and buoyant polypropylene materials designed for many years of service. Some deep ocean moorings have operated without failure for over 10 years.\n\nIn addition to their use in operational forecasting, warnings, and atmospheric models, moored buoy data are used for scientific and research programs, emergency response to chemical spills, legal proceedings, and engineering design.",

Daily-mean data were telemetered to shore in near real-time via NOAA's polar-oribiting satellites and Service Argos.

Also known as \u201cD2,\u201d the vehicle is operated off NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer with its sister vehicle, Seirios.\n\nCapable of diving to depths of 3.7 miles (6,000 meters), D2 provides scientists unprecedented access to the deep ocean. The main capability of Deep Discoverer is the ability to capture high-definition video, with the vehicle\u2019s primary camera able to zoom in on a three-inch long organism from 10 feet away. D2\u2019s 20 LED lights provide 150,000 lumens of light, illuminating the otherwise dark depths of the ocean.\n\nEquipped with two manipulator arms, Deep Discoverer is capable of collecting both biological and geological samples. The ROV is also outfitted with a variety of sensors to measure parameters such as salinity, water temperature, depth, and dissolved oxygen, providing additional information about the deep-ocean environment. Also available are five 1.7-liter Niskin bottles for water collection and a rotary suction sampler with six 4-liter sample jars for collecting more delicate biological samples.\n\nAs a \u201cremotely\u201d operated vehicle, D2 carries no passengers. The vehicle is connected to Seirios and Okeanos Explorer via a long cable and is piloted by GFOE engineers on the ship. Thanks to telepresence technology, live video from D2 travels from the seafloor to the ship and then via satellite connection to scientists located on shore who use the real-time video to provide guidance to the pilots on where to go and which samples to collect. The live video is also broadcast to the Internet, allowing members of the public to join in on D2\u2019s adventures.\n\nFrom delivering stunning high-definition video and gathering physical data about surrounding waters to allowing the collection of biological and geological samples, D2 is delivering data needed by scientists to better understand an ecosystem in its entirety, meaning we can make better decisions about an area's management as well as its protection.",

The vehicle is managed and operated by the Canadian Scientific Submersible Facility , a nationally registered not-for-profit corporation established in 1995 specifically to oversee the ROPOS system.\n\nWhile ROPOS is used for a variety of different types of deployments, the ROV specializes in supporting science-based missions and carries a suite of \u201ccore\u201d observation tools  to assist with these missions. These tools include a number of video and still cameras and robust lighting to capture the otherwise dark underwater environment; two manipulator arms that can be fitted with different tools for collecting biologic and geologic samples; a multibeam system for mapping the seafloor; and much more. In fact, for each mission, ROPOS can be outfitted with up to eight additional custom-designed observation tools.\n\nROPOS is an unmanned submersible, controlled from a surface vessel through an armored electrical-optical umbilical cable. This means that the ROV can spend as much time underwater as needed to accomplish a mission. To date, the longest dive recorded by ROPOS lasted over 99 hours!\n\nROPOS and its crew conduct missions all over the world and have explored in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans as well as the sub-Arctic and Antarctica.",

Its design gives scientists access to most of the globe\u2019s seafloor, often for days at a time, without leaving the deck of a ship.\n\nThe vehicle can operate as either a two-body (with ROV Medea) or a single-body system, depending on mission requirements. A 10-kilometer (6-mile) reinforced fiber-optic cable delivers electrical power and control signals from the ship to the vehicle and returns data and live video imagery throughout a dive. When Medea is used, it acts as a \u201cshock absorber\u201d shielding Jason from the movement of the ship and cable. For the DEEP SEARCH mission, Jason will be operated in single-body mode with a series of floats attached to the cable to dampen the influence of the surface swell.\n\nJason is equipped with sonars, video and still imaging systems, lighting, and a flexible payload of sensors and sampling systems. The vehicle\u2019s manipulator arms collect samples just by picking them up, or by deploying sampling gear provided by the science team, such as push cores and mussel pots. The samples are then placed in the vehicle\u2019s basket or on \u201celevator\u201d platforms that float samples to the surface, permitting Jason to stay submerged for as much as a week at a time.",

But as we all know, many good things come in small packages. Little Herc came to the Okeanos Explorer through collaboration between NOAA\u2019s Office of Ocean Exploration and Research and Dr. Robert Ballard\u2019s Institute for Exploration (IFE) at the University of Rhode Island (URI). With a major commitment to explore the waters off Indonesia, our Program\u2019s much larger ROV could not be readied in time for our 2010 sailing date. As a result, Little Herc was chosen as our stand-in.\n\nOriginally developed by a team of engineers at IFE, Little Herc first came into the spotlight when he gave the world the first and only images of John Kennedy\u2019s PT Boat; PT-109. After several other successful missions for IFE, Little Herc stepped down, taking a back seat to the now much larger and spectacular, \u201cHercules\u201d. After doing a short stint as an exhibit piece in the Mystic Aquarium, a proposal by the NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration has given new life to the veteran \u201cExplorer\u201d. Through a Joint Project Agreement (JPA) between NOAA, IFE and URI, a team of engineers from several institutions and companies once again went to work, this time recommissioning Little Herc. In a field where technology advances rapidly, it was necessary and appropriate that Little Herc receive a substantial upgrade before joining the ship. After an extensive 4 month overhaul, Little Herc boasted a new motor controller and power bottle system, an upgraded fiber optic multiplexer system, a new Ultra Short Baseline Tracking System (USBL), a full color imaging sonar, a new Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) sensor, two new single chip color CCD cameras, two new LED lights, two 400watt HMI Lights and a spectacular High Definition video camera. New tethers, new tether terminations, a new transformer, a new electrical junction box, new depth and altitude sensors, a new light bar and a new version of control software to make it all work was in order.\n\nTested at the University of New Hampshire\u2019s Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping prior to arrival in Hawaii for field trails, Little Herc has now come full circle. Today, the beautiful images you are seeing are once again, Little Herc\u2019s major contribution. Made possible by the generous support of our partners and engineers, Little Herc is back. Diving deeper, shining brighter and taking higher resolution imagery than ever before! And my thanks to everyone.",

This tether is only 2.1 cm in diameter and contains 3 copper conductors and 3 single-mode optical fibers. It is incredibly strong with a breaking strength of 18,600 kilograms. Jason is designed to conduct a diverse range of scientific investigations in the world's oceans. The ROV system also includes the vehicle Medea, which serves as a shock absorber and allows Jason to be decoupled from surface and ship motion. The fiber optic tether runs from the ship to Medea, and then down to Jason, to provide real-time communication to and from the vehicles. When Jason is in the water, it requires three people to operate it: a pilot (who operates the vehicle controls), an engineer (who monitors all of the systems and operates the winch that pays out/hauls in the fiber optic cable attached to Medea), and a navigator (who is responsible for positioning the ship so that the system operates in the desired locations). In addition to these three people during each 4-hour watch, 3 to 5 scientists will also be in the control van working with the Jason crew to accomplish the scientific goals of the cruise.",

Because Argus lacks a buoyancy module and is built of heavy stainless steel, its movements are controlled by moving the ship or raising and lowering the cable. A short 100-foot (30-meter) tether connects Hercules to Argus. By keeping the tether between Argus and Hercules slack, Argus can absorb the brunt of any ship movements, so that Hercules, the workhorse of the duo, can remain stable and collect high-definition video from the seafloor.\n\nArgus carries a high-definition video camera similar to the one on Hercules, as well as large lights that illuminate the area around Hercules. The overhead view from Argus allows the pilots and scientists to get a better of view Hercules' surroundings. Thrusters on Argus control its heading, so pilots \u201cflying\u201d the ROV while sitting in the control room on E/V Nautilus can aim the video cameras and lights toward Hercules and sites of interest.\n\nAlthough Hercules is depth rated to 2.5 miles (4,000 meters), when operating alone, Argus can dive deeper \u2013 down to 3.7 miles (6,000 meters).",

The human occupied vehicle is capable of reaching depths of 4,500 meters, carrying two scientists and one pilot for each dive. Image courtesy of Luis Lamar, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Download larger version (jpg, 476 KB).\n\nThe human-occupied vehicle (HOV) Alvin enables direct data collection and observation by two scientists of the seafloor and water column to depths reaching 2.8 miles (4,500 meters) on dives lasting up to 10 hours with the support of an experienced, multi-talented support team. The Alvin Group  and their equipment meet the highest safety and reliability standards as a result of decades of operational and engineering expertise. Continual innovation and the application of the latest technological advancements puts Alvin at the forefront of expeditionary research.\n\nIts seven reversible thrusters permit Alvin to hover in the water, maneuver over rugged topography, or rest on the seafloor. With an experienced pilot at the controls, it can collect data throughout the water column, produce a variety of maps, and perform photographic surveys. Alvin also has two robotic arms that can manipulate instruments and obtain samples  ranging from hard-rock geology to delicate biology, and its sampling basket can be reconfigured daily based on the needs of each dive.\n\nAlvin is a proven and reliable platform capable of diving for up to 30 days in a row before requiring a scheduled maintenance day. Recent collaborations with autonomous vehicles such as Sentry have proven expansive, allowing research teams to visit promising sites to collect samples and data in-person within hours of being discovered, and University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS)-driven technological advances have improved the ability for scientific outreach and collaboration via telepresence.\n\nCurrently rated to 4,500 meters, Alvin gives researchers in-person access to about two-thirds of the ocean floor. The sub\u2019s most recent upgrade, completed in 2014, increased the depth rating of many of the vehicle\u2019s systems, putting it just steps away from having a depth rating of 4.04 miles (6,500 meters) that would provide access to approximately 98 percent of the seafloor.",

At 23 ft long, 8 ft 3 in wide and 9 ft 7 in high, the Clelia travels at a maximum speed of 3 knots and is classed and certified to a maximum operating depth of 1,000 feet by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS).\n\nThe vehicle can accommodate two scientists/observers and a pilot allowing excellent visibility through the forward acrylic hemisphere. The proximity of the occupants to the bottom (approximately 18\") allows tasks to be completed in areas of low visibility. Researchers are afforded an excellent view of the ocean environment through 10 view ports. A hemispheric, 3-ft-diameter window is located at the front end of the sub. Eight 8-in diameter ports are equally spaced around the conning tower of the sub, and one upward view port is in the center of the overhead hatch.\n\nClelia is outfitted with active sonar, still and video cameras, as well as a seven-function hydraulic manipulator equipped with a suction sampler, clam bucket scoop and jaws capable of handling bottom cores and other sampling devices. The manipulator can lift up to 150 lbs. The various collections are placed in the rotating sampler that allows for both quantitative and qualitative sampling. The Clelia is equipped with still and video cameras. Two 500-watt metal halide lights, ideal for photography, can illuminate an area to near-daylight conditions.\n\nThe highly maneuverable submersible is ideally suited for multiple short dives as well as longer duration, more complex dives. The Clelia can be balanced midwater to absolutely neutral buoyancy, providing an extremely stable platform from which to observe, collect samples and shoot photographs and video.\n\nTypical applications include benthic and/or mid-water observations, photo/video documentation and collection of organisms; dump site inspections and monitoring; punch and box coring; search and recovery; bottom surveys; photogrammetric surveys; archaeological site documentation and recovery; and environmental impact studies.\n\nMaintained and operated by experienced and expert pilots and crew, it is further supported by an in-house engineering staff. Working with the support staff, researchers also can add their own equipment, usually other cameras or sampling equipment, to the Clelia. The additional equipment, however, must be tested and certified that it can withstand deep-sea pressures. Harbor Branch also requires that researchers provide their equipment ahead of time to ensure that it can be interfaced properly with the Clelia\u2019s existing equipment.",

At 23.6 ft long, 10.9 ft high and 8.3 ft wide, these highly maneuverable submersibles can dive to a depth of 3,000 ft and travel at a maximum speed of one knot. Edwin Albert Link, engineer, inventor, and friend of Harbor Branch founder Seward Johnson, working at Harbor Branch, designed and built the JSL in 1971, at Mr. Johnson\u2019s request. Harbor Branch constructed the JSL II, which is virtually identical to the JSL I, in 1975.\n\nThe JSL has two separate pressure hulls and can accommodate four people. Aft compartment occupants enter the sub through a bottom-facing 20 inch-wide hatch. The front chamber, which contains the sub\u2019s controls, is a 5-ft-diameter sphere made of five-in thick, clear acrylic. It provides a panoramic view for the pilot and one observer. Because acrylic is a good insulator and hampers conductivity of cold ocean temperatures, the front compartment actually requires air conditioning. The second chamber, the stern compartment, houses another crew member and a second observer. The occupants have access to two side view ports and a video monitor.",

At 23.6 ft long, 10.9 ft high and 8.3 ft wide, these highly maneuverable submersibles can dive to a depth of 3,000 ft and travel at a maximum speed of one knot. Edwin Albert Link, engineer, inventor, and friend of Harbor Branch founder Seward Johnson, working at Harbor Branch, designed and built the JSL in 1971, at Mr. Johnson\u2019s request. Harbor Branch constructed the JSL II, which is virtually identical to the JSL I, in 1975.\n\nThe JSL has two separate pressure hulls and can accommodate four people. Aft compartment occupants enter the sub through a bottom-facing 20 inch-wide hatch. The front chamber, which contains the sub\u2019s controls, is a 5-ft-diameter sphere made of five-in thick, clear acrylic. It provides a panoramic view for the pilot and one observer. Because acrylic is a good insulator and hampers conductivity of cold ocean temperatures, the front compartment actually requires air conditioning. The second chamber, the stern compartment, houses another crew member and a second observer. The occupants have access to two side view ports and a video monitor.",

She is powered by twin diesels coupled to very powerful jet drives and is uniquely outfitted with complete station keeping capability.  Lacking the need to anchor, she is an ideal platform for Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) operations. Additionally, Annie is ideally equipped for side-scan and multibeam sonar projects, gravity coring, or any other sensor deployments with no anchoring required.\n\nThe vessel is also designed to be deployed in remote locations, using a heavy-lift helicopter or from larger ships such as ice breakers using ship-mounted cargo cranes.  The cabin is uniquely set up as a fully climate controlled control room with significant console workspace and room for rack-mounting electronics.  Interior custom framework facilitates the mounting of a large array of high definition video and computer monitors, as well as navigation and audio equipment.\n\nShe is currently being used for research in Yellowstone Lake, supporting Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), ROV and multiple coring and sensor deployments, but can easily be trailered to other areas of interest.  Annie is named after the first vessel to sail on Yellowstone Lake during the Hayden Expedition in 1871.",

After non-usable parts and asbestos were also removed and a diesel engine was installed, the vessel was reborn as an oceanographic research vessel MIRAI on August 21, 1996.\n\nMIRAI provides excellent navigational performance and resistance to ice. The vessel can conduct long-term observational studies over wide areas, and is used for oceanographic surveys primarily in the subtropic and subarctic regions of the Arctic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. It is hoped that MIRAI will perform a role as an advanced international station for ocean-based, marine-Earth research as well as function as a base for transmitting various types of marine and Earth data.",

It was launched in 1965. The vessel is 133 ft\nlong with a 31-foot beam. It is 433 gross tons based on the International admeasurements system.\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) is its owner and also funded the vessel\u2019s construction.\nScripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California in San Diego, initially operated the\nvessel under agreement with NSF. The vessel was originally designed to meet the needs of\nexperimental marine biology and was specifically built to conduct this research along the\nAustralian Great Barrier Reef, the Amazon River and Bering Sea. To meet the latter requirement,\nthe vessel\u2019s hull was ice strengthened to allow it to operate around the ice edge and in ice\nconditions. In 1966 and 1967, the vessel operated in tropical waters of the Great Barrier Reef and\nAmazon River. In 1968 it proceeded to the Bering Sea for operations. It was soon learned that\nthe vessel lacked the power to penetrate deeply into the ice pack unless escorted by icebreaker.\nIts shortcomings pointed out the need for a larger more capable icebreaking research and this was\nthe initial impetus to the design of the ARRV.",

In order to exploit this new technique, GONG has developed a six-station network of extremely sensitive, and stable velocity imagers located around the Earth to obtain nearly continuous observations of the SUN's \"five-minute\" oscillations, or pulsations.\n\nThe site comprising the GONG Network are:\nBig Bear, California\nCerro Tololo, Chile\nLearmonth, Australia\nMauna Loa, Hawaii\nUdaipur, India\nObservatorio del Teide, Canary Islands\n\nThe five-minute oscillation is a subtle effect. Individual modes may exhibit velocities of less than 0.2 meters/second, while the sum of all of the modes is only a few hundred meters/second. The ultimate intention is to have the measurements be limited by the Sun's ``random'' surface motions. This means developing six stable instruments capable of making imaged velocity measurements with a precision of significantly less than one meter/second - one part in ten million! A low technological risk instrument based on a Michelson interferometer was selected, and it will be supported by a highly automated, portable installation, somewhat reminiscent of a spacecraft experiment.\n\nEach station in the network will produce more than 200 megabytes of data every day. Over the three year observing run, the raw data will exceed one terabyte, and the various processed data sets will exceed this several-fold. To keep up with the data flow, a pipe-line capable of roughly 6 Megaflops has be established to do the bulk processing and provide subsets of the data for the scientific community. Because of the widespread scientific participation, distributed data, software and analysis tools will be provided. Thus, in addition to a central facility, participating scientists will have access to readily transportable data archives and software, as well as shared analysis programs at their home institutions.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GONG NETWORK\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: In Situ Land-based Platforms\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SOLAR/SPACE MONITORING STATIONS\n      Short_Name: GONG NETWORK\n      Long_Name: Global Oscillation Network Group\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: GONG\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: INTERFEROMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-12-10\n   Online_Resource: http://gong.nso.edu/info/\n   Sample_Image: http://gong.nso.edu/instrument/outside_shelter.jpg\nEnd_Group",

Earth's ionosphere reacts to the intense x-ray and ultraviolet radiation released during a solar flare. The ionospheric disturbance enhances VLF radio propagation. By monitoring the signal strength of a distant VLF transmitter, sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) are recorded and indicate a recent solar flare event.\n\nAll SID monitoring stations are homebuilt by the observers. Instructions for constructing the VLF receiver and antenna can be obtained from the AAVSO Solar Division chairman. The receiver design has progressed remarkably as the SID program participants have been inspired to improve signal sensitivity and noise rejection. Recent SID station receivers follow a design developed by SID Technical Coordinator Art Stokes. The Stokes Gyrator receiver can be built and tuned by anyone with simple soldering skills. A small indoor loop antenna captures the radio wave for amplification and rectification by the receiver. The SID station operates unattended until the end of each month. Recordings are then analyzed for the beginning, end, and duration of SID events.",

ESRL accomplishes this mission primarily through long-term measurements of key atmospheric species at sites spanning the globe, including five fully-equipped Baseline Observatories. These key species include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, nitrous oxide, surface and stratospheric ozone, halogenated compounds including CFC replacements, hydrocarbons, sulfur gases, aerosols, and solar and infrared radiation. The measurements are of the highest quality and accuracy possible, and document global ch!  anges in key atmospheric species, which are all affected by mankind, identifying sources of interannual variability. In addition, research programs in key regions, utilizing an array of platforms including aircraft, balloons, ocean vessels and towers, complement the land-based information. ESRL's data are used to assess climate forcing, ozone depletion and baseline air quality, to develop and test diagnostic and predictive models, and to keep the public, policy makers, and scientists abreast of the current state of our chemical and radiative atmosphere.",

Because it is impractical to cover the earth with monitoring stations, the answer to global coverage lies in reliable satellite-based estimates. Efforts are underway at NASA and universities to develop algorithms to do this, but such projects are in their infancy. In concert with these ambitious efforts, accurate and precise ground-based measurements in differing climatic regions are essential to refine and verify the satellite-based estimates, as well as to support specialized research.\n\nTo fill this niche, the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) was established in 1993 through the support of NOAA's Office of Global Programs. The SURFRAD mission is clear; its primary objective is to support climate research with accurate, continuous, long-term measurements of the surface radiation budget over the United States. This differs from DOE's ARM/SGP site, where surface radiation budget measurements are also being made, in that ARM uses clustered measurements over a limited area for process-oriented studies.",

This platform made regular measurement stops between the Grafton WDNR site and the Sheboygan Spaceport site to investigate N-S and shallow E-W gradients. The ozone measurements were taken at a height of 3 m for at least 5 minute increments at each location. The 15 stops are described in 1371 Table 2.6.2. On June 2, 3, 12, 13, and 17 the UW-Eau Claire vehicle drove the route of some combination\nof the stops (e.g. Stops 1-13 on June 2, Stops 10-15 multiple times on June 3 to correspond to ship and aircraft measurements made concurrently). Data from the ozone monitor was obtained using 1 minute averaged signal. The duty cycle of the Personal Ozone Monitor subtracts a background (scrubbed ozone)\nUV-signal from a whole air sample, which accounts for the UV absorption of water. However, drastically changing humidity can lead to higher standard deviations in this instrument, which is why the vehicle chose to stop at a single location to measure ozone.",

The computed ozone budget explicitly accounts for stratosphere/troposphere exchange (STE) and in situ ozone production using on-line chemical calculations. The east Asian O3 budget is computed during the period from 7 March to 12 April 2001. Gross formation dominates STE by a ratio of 7 to 1 in east Asia during TRACE-P. However, this ratio is strongly influenced by altitude of the tropopause. Approximately 30% of the ozone that is advected across the tropopause over east Asia is subsequently advected out over the western Pacific within the upper 4 km of the troposphere by the Japan jet. The average net photochemical production (gross formation-gross destruction) within the regional domain is 0.37 Tg d\u22121 or 7% of the average flux at the eastern boundary of the domain during the TRACE-P time period. The budget analysis shows a very close balance between sources and sinks within the RAQMS regional domain during the TRACE-P time period. This balance results in very small average accumulation (\u223c1 Tg) of O3 in the east Asian region and very little net export averaged over the period (0.03 Tg d\u22121). The low ozone export from east Asia predicted by RAQMS during TRACE-P is a consequence of relatively high dry deposition rates, which are 37% of the gross ozone formation (1.469 Tg d\u22121) within the TRACE-P regional domain.",

It was introduced to replace the original MERRA dataset because of the advances made in the assimilation system that enable assimilation of modern hyperspectral radiance and microwave observations, along with GPS-Radio Occultation datasets. It also uses NASA's ozone profile observations that began in late 2004. Additional advances in both the GEOS model and the GSI assimilation system are included in MERRA-2. Spatial resolution remains about the same (about 50 km in the latitudinal direction) as in MERRA.\n\nAlong with the enhancements in the meteorological assimilation, MERRA-2 takes some significant steps towards GMAO\u2019s target of an Earth System reanalysis. MERRA-2 is the first long-term global reanalysis to assimilate space-based observations of aerosols and represent their interactions with other physical processes in the climate system. MERRA-2 includes a representation of ice sheets over (say) Greenland and Antarctica.",

The tracer model uses winds generated by a global general circulation model to advect and convect CO2; no explicit diffusion coefficients are employed. A biospheric exchange function constructed from a map of net primary productivity, and Alzvedo's (1982) seasonality of CO2 uptake and release closely simulates the annual cycles at coastal stations. The results show that zonal homogeneity in surface CO2 concentrations can never be achieved at mid-latitudes where the time scale for zonal mixing is longer than the time scale for biospheric exchange. Analysis of the zonal mean balance in the lower troposphere reveals that atmospheric transport processes may later the CO2 response to local biospheric exchanges by 50% or more. Hence year-to-year variation of the annual CO2 cycle may result from the natural variability of the atmospheric circulation as well as from changes in the sources and sinks.",

The formulation of the CCM has steadily improved over the past two decades, computers powerful enough to run the model have become relatively inexpensive and widely available, and usage of the model has become widespread in the university community, and at some national laboratories.\n\nA limitation of the original CCM was that it did not include models of the global ocean and sea ice. Accordingly, in 1994, NCAR scientists submitted a plan to National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop and use a Climate System Model (CSM) that was to include models of the atmosphere, land surface, ocean, and sea ice. These components were to be coupled without resorting to any \"flux adjustments.\" The plan was to focus initially on the physical aspects of the climate system, and then in a subsequent version to improve biogeochemistry and coupling to the upper atmosphere. The first phase of this project was the model development by the NCAR staff, after which the model and associated data sets were to be made available to the scientific community. In addition, a new governance structure was promised, in which the interested scientific community would be given a fair opportunity to participate in all aspects of the CSM. NSF approved the plan, and model development began immediately.\n\nIn May 1996, the first CSM Workshop was held in Breckenridge, Colorado. At this workshop the CSM components and the results of an early equilibrium climate simulation were presented. Working groups began to form, and the nature of future CSM governance was discussed. At the final plenary session of the workshop, the proposed management structure was discussed, modified, and adopted. At that point, the second phase of CSM, including full participation of the scientific community, had begun.\n\nThe period since this 1996 workshop has been a time of substantial organizational progress. A Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) has been formed to lead the CSM activity, working groups have been producing useful output, and the previously existing Climate Modeling, Analysis and Prediction (CMAP) Advisory Council has been reorganized as the CSM Advisory Board (CAB). In addition to support from NSF, interest in the CSM from other agencies, notably the Department of Energy (DOE) and NASA, has developed. While working toward the second version of CSM, we believed that it was also time to recognize the community of users and sponsors by changing the name of the model to the Community Climate System Model (CCSM).",

The direction and length of trajectories are useful in diagnosing processes that may affect particular air masses under certain conditions. In this regard it is important that parcel trajectories are determined accurately.\n\nThe three-dimensional (3D) algorithm presented here (traj3d) builds on the two-dimensional (2D) model of Law (1993) and reported in application by Perrin and Simmonds (1995). From a specified parcel location in the atmosphere, xn at time n, a finite integral is solved to advect the parcel and generate the trajectory path. Given the 3D wind v(xn) the governing prognostic equation for the trajectory path over a short time interval \u0394t is  xn+1 = xn + v \u0394t . The wind at a given point is found by cubically interpolating from a spatial grid then linearly in time. For back trajectories the wind direction is reversed. The finite integral is solved using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme to obtain an estimate of the wind. This method is considerably more accurate for trajectory calculations than a simple first-order approach. For mathematical details about the 3D algorithm see Noone and Simmonds (1999) and Barras and Simmonds (2009).\n\nWe present an implementation of the 3D algorithm in Fortran 77 that is suitable for any platform given an appropriate compiler. A precompiled Linux version is also available. The input to the program is a simple binary format referred to as CMP. At present the input data (usually 3D winds) are limited to constant pressure levels (e.g. 1000, 925, 850 hPa etc) as is the case with the commonly available reanalysis products e.g. NCEP reanalysis. The output of the program is a NetCDF file (and therefore NetCDF libraries need to be accessible for compilation) and this may be imported into many software packages e.g. Matlab, NCL, for subsequent analysis and plotting. We include some utilities to convert from NetCDF (a common format for 3D meteorological fields like winds) to CMP as well as plotting the trajectories based on NCAR Graphics/NCL.\n\nAlthough intended for computing 3D trajectories the algorithm is equally applicable to 2D trajectory studies e.g. 10 m winds, or a single pressure level e.g. 500 hPa. Finally, it is possible to interpolate auxiliary variables e.g. air temperature, to the trajectory positions and include these in the output NetCDF file.",

SPEAR (Seamless System for Prediction and EArth System Research) is built from component models recently developed at GFDL\u2014the AM4 atmosphere model, MOM6 ocean code, LM4 land model, and SIS2 sea ice model. The SPEAR models are specifically designed with attributes needed for a prediction model for seasonal to decadal time scales, including the ability to run large ensembles of simulations with available computational resources. For computational speed SPEAR uses a coarse ocean resolution of approximately 1.0\u00b0 (with tropical refinement). SPEAR can use differing atmospheric horizontal resolutions ranging from 1\u00b0 to 0.25\u00b0. The higher atmospheric resolution facilitates improved simulation of regional climate and extremes. SPEAR is built from the same components as the GFDL CM4 and ESM4 models but with design choices geared toward seasonal to multidecadal physical climate prediction and projection. We document simulation characteristics for the time mean climate, aspects of internal variability, and the response to both idealized and realistic radiative forcing change. We describe in greater detail one focus of the model development process that was motivated by the importance of the Southern Ocean to the global climate system. We present sensitivity tests that document the influence of the Antarctic surface heat budget on Southern Ocean ventilation and deep global ocean circulation. These findings were also useful in the development processes for the GFDL CM4 and ESM4 models.",

R.; Song, Y.; Asefi-Najafabady, S.; Rayner, P. J.\nAbstract\nThe Fossil Fuel Data Assimilation System (FFDAS) quantifies fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the planet at a scale of 10 km hourly for the time period 1997-2012. FFDAS is based on the Kaya identity constrained by multiple ground and space-based observations. Among these are the DMSP nightlights, Landscan population, and the Ventus power plant database. We have recently downscaled the FFDAS version 2.0 to 1 km x 1 km resolution using nighlights. The finer spatial resolution allows for the examination of urban emissions across the planet. We take two approaches to examination of urban FFCO2 emissions. The first, utilizes named administrative boundaries combined with manual GIS identification (supported by LandSat and ISA) to identify the top emitting urban areas of the planet. We also utilize an urban land mask, without governmental boundary identification, to analyze all urban area by country across the planet. We perform multiple regression to identify key drivers and patterns. The results demonstrate the change in urban emissions during the last decade and assess the question of whether urban areas exhibit scaling properties vis a vis FFCO2 emissions.\n\n\nPublication: \nAmerican Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2015, abstract id.

The second paper focuses on ensemble evaluations with long-term regional (basin) and global scale data sets. The enhanced conceptual realism includes (1) the vegetation canopy energy balance, (2) the layered snowpack, (3) frozen soil and infiltration, (4) soil moisture-groundwater interaction and related runoff production, and (5) vegetation phenology. Sample local-scale validations are conducted over the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) site, the W3 catchment of Sleepers River, Vermont, and a French snow observation site. Noah-MP shows apparent improvements in reproducing surface fluxes, skin temperature over dry periods, snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, and runoff over Noah LSM version 3.0. Noah-MP improves the SWE simulations due to more accurate simulations of the diurnal variations of the snow skin temperature, which is critical for computing available energy for melting. Noah-MP also improves the simulation of runoff peaks and timing by introducing a more permeable frozen soil and more accurate simulation of snowmelt. We also demonstrate that Noah-MP is an effective research tool by which modeling results for a given process can be interpreted through multiple optional parameterization schemes in the same model framework.",

The model also utilizes Photosynthetic Irradiance (PI) parameters derived from years of consistent field observations to estimate phytoplankton carbon fixation rates. The model is the next generation implementation of the model proposed by Fee (1973) and Lang and Fahnenstiel (1996).

However, the data from 1948-1957 is a little different, in the regular (non-Gaussian) gridded data.

The model contains four explicit phytoplankton taxonomic groups: diatoms, cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, and coccolithophores, to represent the large scale biodiversity of the global oceans. Carbon and nutrient distributions, as well as fluxes of carbon between atmosphere and oceans, are included in this product.",

Its primary purpose is to derive the upstream influence region on atmospheric measurement locations. In other words, it is a fast tool to retrieve the adjoint of tracer transport, i.e. the sensitivity of atmospheric tracer mixing ratio measured at receptor point with respect to upstream surface fluxes. STILT is driven by meteorological fields (most important wind fields) from a variety of weather prediction models (ECMWF, WRF, RAMS, ...), for both analysis of past observations or for measurement planning purposes using forecasts. STILT includes turbulence as a stochastic process.\n\nSTILT is being used by a growing community for interpreting trace gas measurements made at ground based stations, on airborne platforms, as well as from remote sensing. Current applications of STILT focus on greenhouse gases and other trace gases, where it is used with high resolution emission inventories and biospheric flux models to provide insight on regional scale budgets.\n\nSTILT is actively developed by a group of researchers at Harvard University, MPI-Jena, University of Waterloo, and Atmospheric & Environmental Research (AER).",

In the MAPS effort, an isentropic coordinate model is used for four\ndimensional assimilation and short range forecast. During FY 1990, the basic MAPS system was installed at the National Meteorological Center (NMC) for use by the National Weather Service (NWS). Within\nFSL, the upper air analysis was run on a three-hour cycle, and was being extended to a one-hour cycle.

                                "description": "FedSat is an Australian scientific microsatellite mission, a\n58cm cube weighing approximately 50 kg. It was launched in early\n2002 from Japan by Japan's National Space Development Agency.\n\nThe purpose of FedSat is to:\n\nEstablish Australian capability in microsatellite technologies\nDevelop expertise necessary for sustaining those industries and\nprofiting from them\n\nTest and develop Australian-developed intellectual property\nProvide a research platform for Australian space science,\ncommunication and GPS studies.\n\nFedSat was developed by the Cooperative Research Centre for\nSatellite Systems, which combines the resources and skills of 12\nAustralian organizations. Contributions from each of the partner\norganizations are doubled by the Commonwealth Government, under\nits Commonwealth Government's Cooperative Research Center?s\nProgram. The total budget of the Centre is approximately\n&#3660 million over 7 years, with &#3620 million of that\nallocated for the FedSat mission. Much of FedSat was developed\nin Australia by the CRCSS. Three of the six main payloads have\nbeen fully developed by the CRCSS, and the other three have been\nsupplied by overseas organizations in consultation with the\nCRCSS.  The satellite platform, the structure that houses and\nmaintains the payloads, is being provided by overseas\norganizations. CRCSS engineers could have developed an\nAustralian platform, but given the time available from\nproject-start to launch, that was not practical. CRCSS opted to\ncontract an overseas platform supplier, avoiding the need to\nreinvent established technologies.  Payloads:\n\n1. GPS Receiver: The GPS, Global Positioning System, is an\nAmerican network of satellites that transmit radio signals\ncontaining time and orbit-position codes. GPS receivers decode\nthe signals, and by comparing signals of up to 4 satellites with\nknown positions, they can derive their own locations by\ntriangulation. The system was designed for mainly military use,\nbut now GPS provides many scientific and civilian applications.\n\n2. NewMag: The NewMag magnetometer is a very sensitive and\nrapid-sampling device for measuring the strength of the Earth's\nmagnetic field. Earth is like a big bar magnet, with magnetic\nfield lines emerging from the poles and far out into\nspace. FedSat's polar orbit crosses all these lines, so NewMag\ncan effectively gain a window into the whole magnetosphere\nregion. NewMag can also measure vibrations simultaneously with\nground- based magnetometers, so investigating the dynamics of\nthe magnetosphere (changes in it shape due to variations in the\nSun), and study magnetospheric wave-propagation.\n\n3. High performance computing: The FedSat high performance\ncomputing payload is the world's first use of reconfigurable\ncomputing technology in space. Reconfigurable computers permit\nchange of their physical circuits via software control; new\nphysical circuits can be installed into a reconfigurable\ncomputer module by remote command. For spacecraft, this\ntechnology means that satellites can be rewired without having\nto retrieve them.\n\n4. Ka-band transponder: The FedSat Ka-band transponder is\ndesigned to handle the new experimental high- frequency and\nhigh-capacity Ka part of the radio spectrum. The transponder\nprocesses signals to and from the ground in the frequency\nband. The transponder incorporates CRCSS-designed Gallium\nArsenide monolithic microwave circuits; FedSat will space\nqualify these for the first time.\n\n5. Baseband processor The baseband processor provides on-board\ncomputer processing of the Ka- and UHF- band payloads. It has\nbeen designed and built by the CRCSS, to operate as a low power\nsingle modem with flexible operation. It will also provide the\nchannel for satellite operations commands.\n\n6. UHF communications payload: The Ultra High Frequency band\npayload will introduce a new type of packet data service for Low\nEarth Orbiting satellites to obtain environmental data. For\nexample, ocean buoys may transmit their data using this means to\norbiting satellites, which are retransmitted back to the lab for\nanalysis.\n\n7. CD ROM: FedSat also carries a compact disc mounted on the\nside, containing the audio messages members of the Australian\npublic recorded to go into space from March to August 2000. The\ndisc also contains a copy of the song From Little Things, Big\nThings Grow, by Paul Kelly, with kind permission of the writers\n(Kev Carmody/Paul Kelly) and publishers (Larrikin Music,\nMushroon Records).\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://www.crcss.csiro.au/overview.htm\"\nand\n\"http://www.crcss.csiro.au/launch/launch.html\"\n\n[Summary provided by CSIRO]",

Since its implementation, GPS has also become an integral asset in numerous civilian applications and industries around the globe, including recreational uses (e.g. boating, aircraft, hiking), corporate vehicle fleet\ntracking, and surveying.\n\nGPS employs 24 spacecraft in 20,200 km circular orbits inclined at 55 degrees. These spacecraft are placed in 6 orbit planes with four operational satellites in each plane. All launches have been successful except for one launch failure in 1981. The full 24-satellite constellation was completed on March 9, 1994.\n\nGPS receivers use triangulation of the GPS satellites' navigational signals to determine their location. The satellites provide two different signals that provide different accuracies. Coarse-acquisition (C/A) code is intended for civilian use, and is deliberately degraded. The accuracy using a typical civilian GPS receiver with C/A code is typically about 100 meters. The military's Precision (P) code is not corrupted, and provides positional accuracy to within approximately 20 meters.\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GPS\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Navigation Platforms\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: GPS (Global Positioning System)\n      Short_Name: GPS\n      Long_Name: Global Positioning System Satellites\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Navstar\n      Short_Name: USA\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: GPS\n      Short_Name: GPS RECEIVERS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 20,200 km\n      Orbit_Type: MEO > Semi-Synchronous > Navigation\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-12\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Primary_Sponsor: U.S. Department of Defense\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

This idea was born during the investigation of the possible application of radio-astronomy technologies for aeronavigation. Further investigations were conducted in a number of the Soviet institutions to increase the accuracy of navigation definitions, global support, daily application and independence from weather conditions. The research results were used in 1963 for R&D project on the first Soviet low-orbit \u201cCicada\u201d system. In 1967 the first navigation Soviet satellite \"Cosmos-192\" was launched. The navigation satellite provided continuous radio navigation signal transmission on 150 and 400 MHz during its active lifetime.\n\nThe \u201cCicada\u201d system of four satellites was commissioned in 1979. The navigation satellites were placed into circular orbits 1,000 km high with an inclination of 83 \u00b0 and equal distribution of orbital planes to the equator. It allowed users to acquire one of the satellites every hour and a half or two and fix the position within 5-6 min of a navigation session. The navigation system \u201cCicada\u201d used one-way user-to-satellite range measurements. Along with improvement of the satellite onboard systems and navigation equipment much attention was given to enhancing accuracy of determining and predicting parameters of the navigation satellite orbits.\n\nLater, receiving measuring equipment was disposed on the \u201cCicada\u201d satellites to detect distress radiobeacons. The satellites received these signals and rebroadcast them to special ground stations where the computation of the exact coordinates of the emergency objects (ships, aircraft, etc.) was held. The \u201cCicada\u201d satellites tracking distress radiobecons formed \u201cCospas\u201d system that together with the US-French-Canadian \"Sarsat\" system built an integrated search and rescue service that saved several thousands of lives. The \u201cCicada\u201d space navigation system (and its \u201cCicada-M\u201d modernization) was designed for navigation support of military users and had been in use since 1976. In 2008 \u201cCicada\u201d and \u201cCicada-M\u201d users started to use GLONASS system and the operation of those systems was halted. It was impossible for the low-orbit systems to meet requirements of a great number of users.\n\nSuccessful operation of the low-orbit satellite navigation systems by the marine users attracted widespread attention to satellite navigation. A general-purpose navigation system was needed to meet the requirements of the great majority of prospective users.\n\nBased on the all-round research it was decided to choose the orbital constellation consisting of 24 satellites equally distributed in three orbital planes inclined at 64.8\u00b0 to the equator. The GLONASS satellites are placed in roughly circular orbits with the nominal orbit altitude 19,100 km and an orbital period of 11 hours, 15 minutes, 44 seconds. Due to the period value it became possible to create a sustainable orbital system that unlike GPS does not require supporting correcting pulses during its active lifetime. The nominal inclination ensures global availability on the territory of the Russian Federation even when several SVs are not operational.\n\nTwo challenges have been faced for designing a high-orbit navigation system. The first one dealt with mutual synchronized satellite timescales with the accuracy of billionths of a second (nanoseconds). It became possible because of high-orbit onboard caesium frequency standards with nominal stability at 10-13 and ground hydrogen frequency standard with nominal stability at 10-14 and also because of ground facilities of time scale comparison with error of 3-5 ns. The second challenge addressed high-precision determination and prediction of navigation satellite orbit parameters. This issue was solved with scientific research on second order factors of infinitesimals, such as light pressure, irregularities of the Earth rotation and polar motions and etc.\n\nFlight tests of the Russian high orbit satellite navigation system, called GLONASS, were started in October, 1982 with the launch of \u201cKosmos-1413\u201d satellite. The GLONASS system was formally declared operational in 1993. In 1995 it was brought to a fully operational constellation (24 GLONASS satellites of the first generation). A great drawback that should have been focused on consisted in the lack of civil navigation equipment and civil users.\n\nReduction in funding for space industry in 1990 led to degradation of the GLONASS constellation. In 2002 the GLONASS constellation consisted of 7 satellites that was insufficient for navigation support of the Russian territory even with limited availability.

                                        "description": "Voyager 1 was one of a pair of spacecraft launched to explore the planets of the outer solar system and the interplanetary environment. Each Voyager had as its major objectives at each planet to: (1) investigate the circulation, dynamics, structure, and composition of the planet's atmosphere; (2) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the satellites of the planet; (3) provide improved values for the mass, size, and shape of the planet, its satellites, and any rings; and, (4) determine the magnetic field structure and characterize the composition and distribution of energetic trapped particles and plasma therein.\n\nOriginally planned as a Grand Tour of the outer planets, including dual launches to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in 1976-77 and dual launches to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune in 1979, budgetary constraints caused a dramatic rescoping of the project to two spacecraft, each of which would go to only Jupiter and Saturn. The new mission was called Mariner Jupiter/Saturn, or MJS. It was subsequently renamed Voyager about six months prior to launch. The rescoped mission was estimated to cost $250 million (through the end of Saturn operations), only a third of what the Grand Tour design would have cost.\n\nOriginally scheduled to launch twelve days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's launch was delayed twice to prevent the occurrence of problems which Voyager 2 experienced after launch. Voyager 1's launch finally happened on 05 Sept. 1977 and was termed \"flawless and accurate\".\n\nAlthough launched sixteen days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's trajectory was the quicker one to Jupiter. On 15 Dec. 1977, while both spacecraft were in the asteroid belt, Voyager 1 surpassed Voyager 2's distance from the Sun. Voyager 1 then proceeded to Jupiter (making its closest approach on 05 March 1979) and Saturn (with closest approach on 12 Nov. 1980). Both prior to and after planetary encounters observations were made of the interplanetary medium. Some 18,000 images of Jupiter and its satellites were taken by Voyager 1. In addition, roughly 16,000 images of Saturn, its rings and satellites were obtained.\n\nAfter its encounter with Saturn, Voyager 1 remained relatively quiescent, continuing to make in situ observations of the interplanetary environment and UV observations of stars. After nearly nine years of dormancy, Voyager 1's cameras were once again turned on to take a series of pictures. On 14 Feb. 1990, Voyager 1 looked back from whence it came and took the first \"family portrait\" of the solar system, a mosaic of 60 frames of the Sun and six of the planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) as seen from \"outside\" the solar system. After this final look back, the cameras on Voyager 1 were once again turned off. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: VOYAGER 1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Interplanetary Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: FLYBY\n      Short_Name: VOYAGER 1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Mariner Jupiter/Saturn A\n      Short_Name: 10321\n      Short_Name: 1977-084A\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-03-06\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/index.html\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1977-084A\n   Sample_Image: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/spacecraft/voyager.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1977-09-05\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Mariner 2 was a backup for the Mariner 1 mission which failed shortly after launch to Venus. The objective of the Mariner 2 mission was to fly by Venus and return data on the planet's atmosphere, magnetic field, charged particle environment, and mass. It also made measurements of the interplanetary medium during its cruise to Venus and after the flyby. \n\nSpacecraft and Subsystems \n\nMariner 2 consisted of a hexagonal base, 1.04 meters across and 0.36 meters thick, which contained six magnesium chassis housing the electronics for the science experiments, communications, data encoding, computing, timing, and attitude control, and the power control, battery, and battery charger, as well as the attitude control gas bottles and the rocket engine. On top of the base was a tall pyramid-shaped mast on which the science experiments were mounted which brought the total height of the spacecraft to 3.66 meters. Attached to either side of the base were rectangular solar panel wings with a total span of 5.05 meters and width of 0.76 meters. Attached by an arm to one side of the base and extending below the spacecraft was a large directional dish antenna. \n\nThe Mariner 2 power system consisted of the two solar cell wings, one 183 cm by 76 cm and the other 152 cm by 76 cm (with a 31 cm dacron extension (a solar sail) to balance the solar pressure on the panels) which powered the craft directly or recharged a 1000 Watt-hour sealed silver-zinc cell battery, which was used before the panels were deployed, when the panels were not illuminated by the Sun, and when loads were heavy. A power-switching and booster regulator device controlled the power flow. Communications consisted of a 3 Watt transmitter capable of continuous telemetry operation, the large high gain directional dish antenna, a cylindrical omnidirectional antenna at the top of the instrument mast, and two command antennas, one on the end of either solar panel, which received instructions for midcourse maneuvers and other functions. \n\nPropulsion for midcourse maneuvers was supplied by a monopropellant (anhydrous hydrazine) 225 N retro-rocket. The hydrazine was ignited using nitrogen tetroxide and aluminum oxide pellets, and thrust direction was controlled by four jet vanes situated below the thrust chamber. Attitude control with a 1 degree pointing error was maintained by a system of nitrogen gas jets. The Sun and Earth were used as references for attitude stabilization. Overall timing and control was performed by a digital Central Computer and Sequencer. Thermal control was achieved through the use of passive reflecting and absorbing surfaces, thermal shields, and movable louvers. \n\nThe scientific experiments were mounted on the instrument mast and base. A magnetometer was attached to the top of the mast below the omnidirectional antenna. Particle detectors were mounted halfway up the mast, along with the cosmic ray detector. A cosmic dust detector and solar plasma spectrometer detector were attached to the top edges of the spacecraft base. A microwave radiometer and an infrared radiometer and the radiometer reference horns were rigidly mounted to a 48 cm diameter parabolic radiometer antenna mounted near the bottom of the mast. All instruments were operated throughout the cruise and encounter modes except the radiometers, which were only used in the immediate vicinity of Venus. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: MARINER 2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Interplanetary Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: FLYBY\n      Short_Name: MARINER 2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Mariner-Venus 1962\n      Short_Name: 00374\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MAGNETOMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-08-13\n   Online_Resource: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/past/mariner1-2.html\n   Sample_Image: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/spacecraft/mariner02.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1962-08-27\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

                                        "description": "Voyager 2 was one of a pair of spacecraft launched to explore the planets of the outer solar system and the interplanetary environment. Each Voyager had as its major objectives at each planet to: (1) investigate the circulation, dynamics, structure, and composition of the planet's atmosphere; (2) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the satellites of the planet; (3) provide improved values for the mass, size, and shape of the planet, its satellites, and any rings; and, (4) determine the magnetic field structure and characterize the composition and distribution of energetic trapped particles and plasma therein.\n\nOriginally planned as a Grand Tour of the outer planets, including dual launches to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in 1976-77 and dual launches to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune in 1979, budgetary constraints caused a dramatic rescoping of the project to two spacecraft, each of which would go to only Jupiter and Saturn. The new mission was called Mariner Jupiter/Saturn, or MJS. It was subsequently renamed Voyager about six months prior to launch. The rescoped mission was estimated to cost $250 million (through the end of Saturn operations), only a third of what the Grand Tour design would have cost.\n\nVoyager 2 was the first of the two spacecraft to be launched, with liftoff occurring 20 Aug. 1977. What was at first an auspicious launch, however, proved to be the beginning of a number of problems. The primary cause of the initial problems were attributed to commanding by the AACS, including difficulty in determining the full deployment of the science boom. These problems resulted in a delay of four days in the launch of Voyager 1 to ensure they wouldn't occur for it.\n\nAlthough launched sixteen days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's trajectory was the quicker one to Jupiter. On 15 Dec. 1977, while both spacecraft were in the asteroid belt, Voyager 1 surpassed Voyager 2's distance from the Sun.\n\nSeveral months after launch, in April 1978, Voyager 2's primary radio receiver failed, automatically kicking in the backup receiver which proved to be faulty. Attempts to recover the use of the primary receiver failed and the backup receiver was used for the remainder of the mission. Although use of the backup receiver made communication with the spacecraft more difficult, engineers were able to find workarounds.\n\nVoyager 2 proceeded with its primary mission and flew by Jupiter (closest approach on 09 July 1979) and Saturn (05 Aug. 1981). During these flybys, Voyager 2 obtained images roughly equal in number to Voyager 1 (18,000 at Jupiter, 16,000 at Saturn).\n\nVoyager 2's launch date had preserved one part of the original Grand Tour design, i.e. the possibility of an extended mission to Uranus and Neptune. Despite the difficulties encountered, scientists and engineers had been able to make Voyager enormously successful. As a result, approval was granted to extend the mission, first to Uranus, then to Neptune and later to continue observations well past Neptune. Voyager 2 made successful flybys of Uranus (24 Jan. 1986) and Neptune (25 Aug. 1989). Because of the additional distance of these two planets, adaptations had to made to accomodate the lower light levels and decreased communications. Voyager 2 was successfully able to obtain about 8,000 images of Uranus and its satellites. Additional improvements in the on-board software and use of image compression techniques allowed about 10,000 images of Neptune and its satellites to be taken.\n\nAll of the experiments on Voyager 2 have produced useful data. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: VOYAGER 2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Interplanetary Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: FLYBY\n      Short_Name: VOYAGER 2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Mariner Jupiter/Saturn B\n      Short_Name: 10271\n      Short_Name: 1977-076A\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-03-06\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/index.html\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1977-076A\n   Sample_Image: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/spacecraft/voyager.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1977-08-20\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

                                        "description": "Pioneer 11 was launched on 5 April 1973, like Pioneer 10, on top of an\nAtlas/Centaur/TE364-4 launch vehicle. After safe passage through the Asteroid\nbelt on 19 April 1974, the Pioneer 11 thrusters were fired to add another 63.7\nm/sec (210 ft/sec) to the spacecraft's velocity. This adjusted the aiming point\nat Jupiter to 43,000 km (26,725 miles) above the cloudtops. The close approach\nalso allowed the spacecraft to be accelerated by Jupiter to a velocity 55 times\nthat of the muzzle velocity of a high speed rifle bullet - 173,000 km/hr\n(108,000 mph) - so that it would be carried across the Solar System some 2.4\nbillion kilometers (1.5 billion miles) to Saturn.\n\nDuring its flyby of Jupiter on 2 December 1974, Pioneer 11 obtained dramatic\nimages of the Great Red Spot, made the first observation of the immense polar\nregions, and determined the mass of Jupiter's moon, Callisto.\n\nLooping high above the ecliptic plane and across the Solar System, Pioneer 11\nraced toward its appointment with Saturn on 1 September 1979. Pioneer 11 flew\nto within 13,000 miles of Saturn and took the first close-up pictures of the\nplanet. Instruments located two previously undiscovered small moons and an\nadditional ring, charted Saturn's magnetosphere and magnetic field and found\nits planet-size moon, Titan, to be too cold for life. Hurtling underneath the\nring plane, Pioneer 11 sent back amazing pictures of Saturn's rings. The rings,\nwhich normally seem bright when observed from Earth, appeared dark in the\nPioneer pictures, and the dark gaps in the rings seen from Earth appeared as\nbright rings.\n\nFollowing its encounter with Saturn, Pioneer 11 explored the outer regions of\nour Solar system, studying energetic particles from our Sun (Solar Wind) and\ncosmic rays entering our portion of the Milky Way. In September 1995, Pioneer\n11 was at a distance of 6.5 billion km (4 billion miles) from Earth. At that\ndistance, it takes over 6 hours for the radio signal (which is traveling at the\nspeed of light) to reach Earth. However, by September 1995, Pioneer 11 could no\nlonger make any scientific observations. On 30 September 1995, routine daily\nmission operations were stopped. Intermittent contact continued until November\n1995, at which time the last communication with Pioneer 11 took place. There\nhave been no communications with Pioneer 11 since. The Earth's motion has\ncarried it out of the view of the spacecraft antenna. The spacecraft cannot be\nmaneuvered to point back at the Earth. It is not known whether the spacecraft\nis still transmitting a signal. No further tracks of Pioneer 11 are scheduled. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: PIONEER 11\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Interplanetary Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: FLYBY\n      Short_Name: PIONEER 11\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Pioneer-G\n      Short_Name: 06421\n      Short_Name: 1973-019A\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-05\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1973-019A\n   Sample_Image: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/spacecraft/pioneer10-11.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1973-04-05\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA/Ames\n      Primary_Sponsor: TRW\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The launch marked the first use of the Atlas-Centaur as a\nthree-stage launch vehicle. The third stage was required to rocket Pioneer 10\nto the speed of 51,810 kilometers per hour (32,400 mph) needed for the flight\nto Jupiter. This made Pioneer the fastest manmade object to leave the Earth,\nfast enough to pass the Moon in 11 hours and to cross the Mars orbit, about 80\nmillion kilometers (50 million miles) away, in just 12 weeks.\n\nOn 15 July 1972 Pioneer 10 entered the Asteroid Belt, a doughnut shaped area\nwhich measures some 280 million kilometers wide and 80 million kilometers\nthick. The material in the belts travels at speed about 20 km/sec. and ranges\nin size from dust particles to rock chunks as big as Alaska.\n\nAfter safely traversing the Asteroid Belt, Pioneer 10 headed toward Jupiter.\nAccelerated by the massive giant to a speed of 132,000 km/hr (82,000 mph),\nPioneer 10 passed by Jupiter within 130,354 km (81,000 miles) of the cloudtops\non December 3, 1973. During the passage by Jupiter, Pioneer 10 obtained the\nfirst close-up images of the planet, charted Jupiter's intense radiation belts,\nlocated the planet's magnetic field, and discovered that Jupiter is\npredominantly a liquid planet.\n\nFollowing its encounter with Jupiter, Pioneer 10 explored the outer regions of\nthe Solar system, studying energetic particles from the Sun (Solar Wind), and\ncosmic rays entering our portion of the Milky Way. The spacecraft continued to\nmake valuable scientific investigations in the outer regions of the solar\nsystem until its science mission ended on March 31, 1997. Since that time,\nPioneer 10's weak signal has been tracked by the DSN as part of an advanced\nconcept study of communication technology in support of NASA's future\ninterstellar probe mission. The spacecraft had also been used to help train\nflight controllers how to acquire radio signals from space during the Lunar\nProspector mission. The power source on Pioneer 10 finally degraded to the\npoint where the signal to Earth dropped below the threshold for detection in\nits latest contact attempt on 7 February, 2003. The previous three contacts had\nvery faint signals with no telemetry received. The last time a Pioneer 10\ncontact returned telemetry data was on 27 April 2002. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: PIONEER 10\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Interplanetary Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: FLYBY\n      Short_Name: PIONEER 10\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Pioneer-F\n      Short_Name: 05860\n      Short_Name: 1972-012A\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-05\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1972-012A\n   Sample_Image: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/spacecraft/pioneer10-11.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1972-03-02\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA/Ames\n      Primary_Sponsor: TRW\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The Venera 13 mission consisted of a bus (81-106A)\nand an attached descent craft (81-106D). The Venera 13 descent\ncraft/lander was a hermetically sealed pressure vessel, which\ncontained most of the instrumentation and electronics, mounted\non a ring-shaped landing platform and topped by an antenna. The\ndesign was similar to the earlier Venera 9-12 landers. It\ncarried instruments to take chemical and isotopic measurements,\nmonitor the spectrum of scattered sunlight, and record electric\ndischarges during its descent phase through the Venusian\natmosphere. The spacecraft utilized a camera system, an X-ray\nfluorescence spectrometer, a screw drill and surface sampler, a\ndynamic penetrometer, and a seismometer to conduct\ninvestigations on the surface.  After launch and a four month\ncruise to Venus, the descent vehicle separated from the bus and\nplunged into the Venus atmosphere on 1 March 1982. After\nentering the atmosphere a parachute was deployed. At an altitude\nof 47 km the parachute was released and simple airbraking was\nused the rest of the way to the surface. Venera 13 landed about\n950 km northeast of Venera 14 at 7 deg 30 min S, 303 E, just\neast of the eastern extension of an elevated region known as\nPhoebe Regio. The area was composed of bedrock outcrops\nsurrounded by dark, fine-grained soil. After landing an imaging\npanorama was started and a mechanical drilling arm reached to\nthe surface and obtained a sample, which was deposited in a\nhermetically sealed chamber, maintained at 30 degrees C and a\npressure of about .05 atmospheres.

The Venera 14 mission consisted of a bus (81-110A)\nand an attached descent craft (81-110D). The Venera 14 descent\ncraft/lander was a hermetically sealed pressure vessel, which\ncontained most of the instrumentation and electronics, mounted\non a ring-shaped landing platform and topped by an antenna. The\ndesign was similar to the earlier Venera 9-12 landers. It\ncarried instruments to take chemical and isotopic measurements,\nmonitor the spectrum of scattered sunlight, and record electric\ndischarges during its descent phase through the Venusian\natmosphere. The spacecraft utilized a camera system, an X-ray\nfluorescence spectrometer, a screw drill and surface sampler, a\ndynamic penetrometer, and a seismometer to conduct\ninvestigations on the surface.  After launch and a four month\ncruise to Venus, the descent vehicle separated from the bus and\nplunged into the Venus atmosphere on 5 March 1982. After\nentering the atmosphere a parachute was deployed. At an altitude\nof about 50 km the parachute was released and simple airbraking\nwas used the rest of the way to the surface. Venera 14 landed\nabout 950 km southwest of Venera 13 near the eastern flank of\nPhoebe Regio at 13 deg 15 min S by 310 E on a basaltic\nplain. After landing an imaging panorama was started and a\nmechanical drilling arm reached to the surface and obtained a\nsample, which was deposited in a hermetically sealed chamber,\nmaintained at 30 degrees C and a pressure of about .05\natmospheres. The composition of the sample was determined by the\nX-ray flourescence spectrometer, showing it to be similar to\noceanic tholeiitic basalts. The lander survived for 57 minutes\n(the planned design life was 32 minutes) in an environment with\na temperature of 465 degrees C and a pr!  essure of 94 Earth\natmospheres. The descent vehicle transmitted data to the bus,\nwhich acted as a data relay as it.\n\n[Source: NASA]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: VENERA-14\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Interplanetary Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: LANDER\n      Short_Name: VENERA-14\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/venera1314.html\nEnd_Group",

                                        "description": "The Echo satellites were NASA's first experimental communications satellite project. Each spacecraft was a large metallized balloon designed to act as a passive communications reflector to bounce communication signals transmitted from one point on Earth to another. Following the failure of the launch vehicle carrying Echo 1, Echo 1A (commonly referred to as Echo 1) was successfully orbited, and was used to redirect transcontinental and intercontinental telephone, radio, and television signals. The success of Echo 1A proved that microwave transmission to and from satellites in space was understood and demonstrated the promise of communications satellites. The vehicle also provided data for the calculation of atmospheric density and solar pressure due to its large area-to-mass ratio. Echo 1A was visible to the unaided eye over most of the Earth (brighter than most stars) and was probably seen by more people than any other man-made object in space. Echo 2 continued the passive communications experiments, and also investigated the dynamics of large spacecraft and was used for global geometric geodesy. Although NASA abandonded passive communications systems in favor of active satellites following Echo 2, the Echo systems demonstrated several ground station and tracking technologies that would be used by active systems. Echo 1A reentered on May 24, 1968 followed by Echo 2 on June 7, 1969. \n\nSpacecraft \n\n1, 1A: each was a 30.5 m diameter balloon made of 0.0127 mm thick mylar polyester film. A set of 107.9-MHz beacon transmitters were carried for telemetry. The transmitters were powered by five nickel-cadmium batteries that were charged by 70 solar cells mounted on the balloon. 2: a 41.1 m diameter mylar balloon that used an improved inflation system to improve the balloon's smoothness and sphericity. Instrumentation included temperature sensors to monitor the balloon's skin temperature and pressure sensors to monitor the balloon's internal pressure. A beacon system, consisting of two transmitter assemblies, provided tracking and telemetry signals. The beacon system used solar cell panels for power and had a minimum power output of 45 mW at 136.17 MHz and 136.02 MHz. \n\n[Summary provided by NASA.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: ECHO-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: ECHO\n      Short_Name: ECHO-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 47.1999 degrees\n      Perigee: 1524 km\n      Apogee: 1684 km\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-09-14\n   Online_Resource: http://msl.jpl.nasa.gov/QuickLooks/echoQL.html\n   Sample_Image: http://msl.jpl.nasa.gov/QuickLooks/pictures/echo.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1960-08-12\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

As of 2020 there were 2,544 satellites in the series. The first was launched on March 16, 1962. Kosmos satellites were used for a wide variety of purposes, including scientific research, navigation, and military reconnaissance. In the Soviet years, failures of probes in other programs were given a Kosmos number. Kosmos 26 and 49 (both launched in 1964), for example, were equipped to measure Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Others were employed to study certain technical aspects of spaceflight as well as physical phenomena in Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere and in deep space. A number of them\u2014such as Kosmos 597, 600, and 602\u2014were apparently used to collect intelligence on the Yom Kippur War (the fourth Arab-Israeli war) in October 1973. Some Kosmos spacecraft had the ability to intercept satellites launched by other nations. Other Kosmos satellites have proved much more notable for how their missions ended. Kosmos 954, a Soviet navy satellite powered by a nuclear reactor, crashed in the Northwest Territories of Canada on January 24, 1978, scattering radioactive debris. The first collision that destroyed an operational satellite happened on February 10, 2009, when Kosmos 2251, an inactive Russian military communications satellite, collided with Iridium 33, a communications satellite owned by the American company Motorola, about 760 km (470 miles) above northern Siberia, shattering both satellites.",

                                "description": "Monitor-E is a Russian Earth observation mission of KhSC (Khrunichev Space Center) on a small-class generic satellite series. The spacecraft was also designed and developed by KhSC of Moscow.\n\nThe Monitor-E mission represents the first operational use of the newly developed modular and multipurpose Yakhta platform, intended for use in various remote sensing, communications, and space research applications.\n\nSpacecraft:\n\nThe spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized using the generic Yakhta platform with a launch mass of 750 kg. The attitude pointing accuracy is 0.1\u00ba, the attitude rate control accuracy is 0.001\u00ba/s (angular drift). Power of 1200 W (max at EOL) is provided by two solar panels. The spacecraft features a cross-track pointing capability of \u00b130\u00ba from nadir by using a flywheel system, thereby providing a FOR (Field of Regard) for observation coverage considerably beyond that of the nominal swath width. This new S/C agility is provided by the introduction of a CMG (Control Moment Gyro) subsystem, an actuator within the ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem), developed by Russian industry. KhSC refers to the ADCS as ICS (Integrated Control System). The S/C system design life is 5 years.\n\nNote: The Monitor-E spacecraft is of Monitor-E heritage (same name of previous and current missions) which was launched on June 30, 2003 from Plesetsk on a Rockot KS vehicle. On this flight, Monitor-E functioned as a mock-up (or prototype) spacecraft of KhSC with a mass of 700 kg. The spacecraft Monitor-E remained attached to the upper stage of the launch vehicle, it was used for demonstration purposes. \n\nRF communications: The payload data are being received in X-band by ground stations of federal, regional, and local levels in Russia. An effort is being made to acquire the data in near real-time in support of fast reaction response applications.\n\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous near-circular orbit: mean altitude = 540 km, inclination = 97.5\u00ba.\n\nLaunch: A launch of Monitor-E took place on Aug. 26, 2005 on a Rockot Breeze-KM launch vehicle of Eurockot Launch Services from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia.\n\nMission status: Monitor-E is operational as of 2007. So far, the spacecraft has collected imagery of more than 80 million km2.\n\n\u2022 After launch and orbit insertion, the spacecraft experienced initial attitude control problems (flight controllers lost contact with the satellite). However, the flight controllers have regained control of Monitor-E, all systems are operating nominally and the spacecraft is in the commissioning phase as of early November 2005 (the checkout phase is estimated to last for up to 6 months to test the new components of the platform and the payload - and to conduct various operational experiments).\n\n\u2022 In Sept. 2006, Monitor-E experienced a malfunction of its ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem). After analysis of the problem nature, a software work-around procedure was developed and successfully installed onboard.\n\nInformation obtained from http://www.eoportal.org/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: MONITOR-E\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: MONITOR-E-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Monitor Experimental\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n      Short_Name: MS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 540 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 97.5 degrees\n      Period: 95.2 minutes\n      Perigee: 532.0 km\n      Apogee: 539.2 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-10\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=11116\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2005-08-26\n      Launch_Site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia\n      Design_Life: 5 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: Khrunichev Space Center, Russia\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Spacecraft  guidance  and  orbital corrections were\naccomplished by a 2.3 kg hydrogen peroxide and hydrazine thrusters, which were\nactivated by ground command.  The satellite was initially placed at 151.16\ndegrees West over the Pacific Ocean in a geosynchronous orbit.  In general,\nmost of the experiments were successful.  Data coverage was nominal until about\n1970, after which limited real-time data acquisition was carried out by NOAA\nuntil the May 1974 launch of SMS 1.  Limited ATS 1 data acquisition was started\nby NASA at about that time for ATS 1 - ATS 6 correlative  studies.  The\nspacecraft served as a communications satellite for a number of state, federal,\nand public organizations.  It continued to operate at its final longitude of\n164 degress East until September 1983, when the spacecraft was moved out of the\ngeostationary orbit.\n__________\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage (SIRS).

Of the 11 experiments on board, 8 were\ntechnological engineering experiments concerned with navigation,\ncommunications, and spacecraft operation equipment; 2 were photographic imaging\nexperiments that produced near real-time daylight pictures of the\nearth-atmosphere system; and the remaining experiment was an ionospheric\nbeacon.  The spin-stabilized spacecraft was cylindrically shaped and measured\n180 cm in length and 142 cm in diameter.  The primary structural members were\na honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube.  Support rods extended radially\noutward from the thrust tube and were affixed to solar panels which formed the\nouter walls of the spacecraft.  Equipment components and payload were mounted\nin the annular space between the thrust tube and solar panels.  In addition to\nsolar panels, the spacecraft was equipped with two rechargeable nickel-cadmium\nbatteries to provide electrical power.\n\nThis satellite supported an image dissector camera, multicolor spin scan\ncloud cover camera, weather facsimile data relay system, omega position and\nlocation equipment designed to demonstrate the feasibility of using the NAVY's\nOmega Navigation System, and VHF, telemetry, and command antennas.  Spacecraft\nguidance and orbital corrections were accomplished by 2.3 kg hydrogen peroxide\nand hydrazine thrusters, which were activated by ground command.  Initially\nplaced at 48 degrees West over the Atlantic Ocean in a geosynchronous orbit,\nthe satellite position later varied between 45 and 95 degrees West in support\nof meteorological operations.  In general, the various experiments were\nsuccessful.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: ATS-3\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: ATS (Advanced Technology Satellite)\n      Short_Name: ATS-3\n      Long_Name: Advanced Technology Satellite-3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Advanced Tech.

The\ncylindrically-shaped spacecraft measured 142 cm in diameter and 183 cm in\nlength.  The primary structural members were a corrugated thrust tube with\nhoneycombed bulkheads secured to each end.  Equipment components and payload\nwere externally mounted on the outer surface of the thrust tube as well as on a\nstructure that slid into the interior of the thrust  tube.  Electric power was\nprovided by two solar arrays mounted on either end of the spacecraft's outer\nshell and by two rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries.  Extending radially\noutward from the side of the spacecraft were four 28.2 m adjustable\ngravity-gradient booms.   The spacecraft telemetry system consisted of four\n2.1-W transmitters, (two at 136.47 MHz and two at 137.35 MHz), in addition to a\nmicrowave  communications  experiment.\n\nThis satellite featured an image orthicon (day/night) camera for the purpose of\ndetermining the feasibility of simultaneous day/night imaging of cloud cover\npatterns from an earth-synchronous spacecraft.  The second stage of the launch\nvehicle failed to to ignite, and the planned synchronous orbit was not\nachieved.  The spacecraft and its Centaur booster rocket were left attached\ntogether in a parking orbit. In spite of the anomalistic attitude, some of the\nexperiments did perform successfully before the satellite and its attached\nrocket booster reentered the earth's atmosphere on October 17, 1968.  The\nprimary objective of inserting a gravity-gradient-stabilized spacecraft into a\ngeosynchronous orbit was not accomplished.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: ATS-4\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: ATS (Advanced Technology Satellite)\n      Short_Name: ATS-4\n      Long_Name: Advanced Technology Satellite-4\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-08-29\n   Online_Resource: http://www.astronautix.com/craft/ats4.htm\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1968-08-10\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Using the unique perspective available from space, NASA will observe, monitor and assess large-scale environmental processes, focusing on climate change. MTPE satellite data, complemented by aircraft and ground data, will allow humans to better understand natural environmental changes and to distinguish natural changes from human induced changes. MTPE data, which NASA will distribute to researchers worldwide, is essential to humans making informed decisions about their environment.\n\nThe goal of the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) Earth Probe mission (part of NASA's Mission To Planet Earth (MTPE) Phase I program) was to continue the high-resolution global mapping of total ozone on a daily basis (begun with the Nimbus 7 SBUV/TOMS) as well as to detect global ozone trends to verify depletion predicted by atmospheric chemistry models.\n\nThe TOMS-Earth Probe (TOMS-EP), the first of a series of NASA Earth Probe missions, was one of three TOMS missions which included METEOR 3/TOMS2 (launched 1991) and ADEOS/TOMS (launched 1995). The TOMS-EP carried only one instrument: the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS).\n\nThe TOMS-EP spacecraft was based on the TRW/DSI Eagle bus developed under the USAF STEP program. The spacecraft was three-axis stabilized so that the TOMS instrument was nadir-pointed with about 0.5 degree control and about 0.1 degree knowledge from measured altitude data. The TOMS-EP spacecraft bus was designed to accomodate all of the TOMS instrument requirements to support a two-year lifetime with a three-year lifetime goal.\n\nThe EP-TOMS Home Page is located at:\nhttp://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/total-ozone-mapping-spectrometer-earth-probe\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: EP-TOMS\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: EP-TOMS\n      Long_Name: Earth Probe-TOMS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: SMEX/TOMS-Earth Probe\n      Short_Name: Small Explorer/TOMS-Earth Probe\n      Short_Name: TOMS-EP96\n      Short_Name: TOMS-Earth Probe\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: TOMS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 740 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.385 degrees\n      Period: 99.6 minutes\n      Perigee: 490.5 km\n      Apogee: 515.2 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-05-01\n   Online_Resource: http://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/total-ozone-mapping-spectrometer-earth-probe\n   Online_Resource: http://science.nasa.gov/missions/toms/\n   Online_Resource: http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/acdisc/TOMS\n   Online_Resource: https://ozoneaq.gsfc.nasa.gov/missions\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1996-07-02\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Design_Life: 2 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Information for archival purposes.]\n\nEarth Observing-1 (EO-1) is an advanced land-imaging mission that will demonstrate new instruments and spacecraft systems. \nEO-1 will validate technologies contributing to the significant reduction in cost of follow-on Landsat missions. Launched \non a Delta 7320 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, November 21, 2000. EO-1 has a 1-year primary mission but was \ndesigned to operate for an additional year.\n\nThe NMP EO-1 mission includes three advanced land imaging instruments and five revolutionary cross cutting spacecraft \ntechnologies. The hyperspectral instrument is the first of its kind to provide images of land-surface in more than 220 \nspectral colors. The Hyperion will demonstrate the ability to perform detailed spectral mapping with high radiometric \naccuracy. In the future, an operational version of the Hyperion will allow complex land ecosystems to be imaged and \naccurately classified. The Advanced Land Imager (ALI) instrument yields almost four times better performance at only \none-fourth the cost and weight of the Landsat ETM+. Finally the Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array/Atmospheric \nCorrector (LEISA/AC) is an infrared camera, which can be used to remove the effects of the atmosphere from surface \npictures obtained by instruments such as the ALI on EO-1 and Landsat. This instrument will provide scientific return \nboth in terms of improved imagery and hyperspectral sensing capabilities. It will also test a number of new technologies. \nBecause the AC is small and adaptable to different spacecraft configurations, it is a bolt-on instrument, which can be \nattached to any future Earth imaging spacecraft. The three advanced imaging instruments will lead to a new generation \nof lighter weight, higher performance and lower cost Landsat-type Earth surface imaging instruments.\n\nKey EO-1 Facts:\nOrbit\nType: Sun-synchronous\nEquatorial Crossing: 10:01 a.m.\nAltitude: 705 km\nInclination: 98.2\u00b0\nPeriod: 98.8 minutes\nRepeat Cycle: 16 days\nDimensions: 2 m height \u00d7 2.5 m diameter\nMass: 529 kg\nPower: 300 W\nDesign Life: 18 months; EO-1 is well beyond its planned mission life and is\nstill functioning\nDownlink: X-Band (105 Mbps), Sioux Falls, Svalbard, Alaska, Hobart (Australia)\nNote: Part of the Morning Constellation of satellites, lags one minute behind\nLandsat 7\nContributors\nALI: MIT/Lincoln Laboratory, NASA GSFC\nHyperion: TRW, NASA GSFC\nLAC: NASA GSFC Applied Engineering and Technology Directorate (AETD)\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\nMore Information: https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/earth-observing-1\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: EO-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: EO-1\n      Long_Name: Earth Observing 1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: New Millennium Program Earth Observing-1 (NMP EO-1)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: LAC\n      Short_Name: ALI\n      Short_Name: HYPERION\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 705 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.2\u00b0\n      Equator_Crossing: 10:01 a.m.\n      Period: 98.8 minutes\n      Repeat_Cycle: 16 days\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-06\n   Online_Resource: https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/earth-observing-1\n   Online_Resource: https://eo1.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2000-11-21\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, California\n      Design_Life: 18 months\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objectives of this program were to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense requirements. Operationally, the program consisted of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 5.4-m-long spacecraft was separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform (PMP) for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module (ESM) containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment (RCE) support structure (including the third-stage motor and hydrazine reaction control system); and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization was controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so sensors could be maintained in the desired \"earth-looking\" mode. One feature was the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allowed automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system (OLS), built by Westinghouse, was the primary data acquisition system that provided real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night visual and infrared imagery of clouds, and provided with the data calibration, timing, and other auxiliary signals to the spacecraft for digital transmission to the ground. A supplementary meterological sensor, the special sensor H (SSH), a step-scanning radiometer, was the infrared temperature-humidity-ozone sounder. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Wash., and Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time data were read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. A more complete description of the satellite can be found in the report, D. A.

This program, previously known as DAAP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objectives of this program are to provide global visual and infrared cloud-cover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense requirements. Operationally, the program consisted of two satellites in planned 830-km sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 5.4-m long spacecraft was separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform (PMP) for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment, (2) an equipment support module (ESM) containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors, (3) a reaction control equipment (RCE) support structure (including the third-stage motor, hydrazine reaction control system) that supported (4) a 9.29 sq m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization was controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system, so that sensors were maintained in the desired 'earth-looking' mode. One feature was the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allowed automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational line scan system (OLS) built by Westinghouse, was the primary data acquisition system that provided real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night visual and infrared imagery at 1/3 nautical mile resolution for all major land masses, 1-1/2 nautical mile resolution for complete global coverage, and provided with this data calibration, timing, and other auxiliary signals to the spacecraft for digital transmission to the ground. A supplementary sensor package, the special sensor H (SSH), a step-scanning radiometer, was the infrared temperature-humidity-ozone sounder. The data processing system, which included three high-density tape recorders, was capable of storing a total of 400 min of data, each allowing full global coverage twice daily. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, WA, and Loring AFB, ME, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Fource Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, NE. Real-time data were read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world.

This, coupled with their polar and \u201csun-synchronous\u201d orbits, allows each DMSP weather satellite to monitor nearly the entire globe every six hours.\n\nThe data collected by the satellites is transmitted to the ground where a team of meteorologists interpret the data and disseminate the information for the U.S. military, which in turn uses the data to plan and conduct U.S. military operations around the globe.\n\nIn addition to DMSP F18, two more DMSP weather satellites are awaiting launch. These satellites are currently stored at Space Systems\u2019 operations in Sunnyvale, California. They will be transported to Vandenberg upon the request of the Air Force for launch operations.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: DMSP 5D-3/F18\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program)\n      Short_Name: DMSP 5D-3/F18\n      Long_Name: Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-F18\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2009-10-21\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/10/live-atlas-600th-mission-launch-dmsp-f18-vandenberg/\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2009-10-18\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: Department of Defense-Department of the Air Force (United States)\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so that sensors are maintained in the desired earth-looking mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system that provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains five special sensors: (1) a microwave temperature sounder, (2) an advanced X-ray detector, (3) an ionospheric/scintillation monitor, (4) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer, and (5) a microwave imager.

Its pre-launch designation was DMSP 5D-2/S9. This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so sensors are maintained in the desired earth-looking mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system that provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains five special sensors: (1) a microwave temperature sounder, (2) an advanced X-ray detector, (3) an ionospheric/scintillation monitor, (4) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer, and (5) a microwave imager. An infrared temperature and moisture sounder and a magnetometer may also be included on this spacecraft. Either recorded or real-time data are transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data are read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Wash., and at Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time data are read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. Additional information concerning this satellite program can be found in the report by D. A.

This allowed automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational line scan system (OLS) built by Westinghouse, was the primary acquisition system that provided real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night visual and infrared imagery at 1/3 nautical mile resolution for all major land masses, 1-1/2 nautical mile resolution for complete global coverage, and provided with this data calibration, timing, and other auxiliary signals to the spacecraft for digital transmission to the ground. A supplementary sensor package, the special sensor H (SSH), a step-scanning radiometer, was the infrared temperature-humidity-ozone sounder. The data processing system, which included three high-density tape recorders, could store a total of 400 min of data, each allowing full global coverage twice daily. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground-receiving sites via two redundant s-band transmitters. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, WA, and Loring AFB, ME, and relayed via SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, NE.

                                "description": "The Heat Capacity Mapping Mission (HCMM) spacecraft was the first of a series\nof Applications Explorer Missions (AEM).  The objective of the HCMM was to\nprovide comprehensive, accurate, high-spatial-resolution thermal surveys of the\nsurface of the earth.  The HCMM spacecraft was made of two distinct modules:\n(1) an instrument module, containing the heat capacity mapping radiometer and\nits supporting gear, and (2) a base module, containing the data handling,\npower, communications, command, and attitude control subsystems required to\nsupport the instrument module.  The spacecraft was spin stabilized at a rate of\n14 rpm.\nThe HCMM circular sun-synchronous orbit allowed the spacecraft to sense surface\ntemperatures near the maximum and minimum of the diurnal cycle.  The orbit had\na daylight ascending node with nominal equatorial crossing time of 2:00 p.m.\nSince there was no inclination adjustment capacity, the spacecraft drifted from\nthis crossing time by about 1 hour earlier per year.  There was no on-board\ndata storage capability, so only real-time data were transmitted when the\nsatellite came within reception range of seven ground stations.  The repeat\ncycle of the spacecraft was 16 days.  Day/night coverage over a given area\nbetween the latitudes of 85 deg N and 85 deg S occurred at intervals ranging\nfrom 12 to 36 h (once every 16 days).\nDuring February  21-23, 1980, the HCMM orbital altitude was lowered from 620 km\nto 540 km to stop the drift of the orbit plane to unfavorable sun angles which\nin turn reduced the power collection capability of the solar panels.  The\noperations of the spacecraft were terminated on September 30, 1980.

Images from the satellite are provided free of charge to relief agencies responding to disasters anywhere in world.\n\nTopSat was designed and built by a consortium of British companies led by QinetiQ, whose role included systems design and technical authority, provision of payload electronics units, project and operations management and data reception. Other consortium members are Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) designed and Infoterra.\n\nThe satellite is designed to return its data directly to a mobile ground station immediately after collecting an image, allowing far more timely delivery of the information which it collects than standard satellites. The system is specifically designed to meet operational timescales, whether for disaster relief, news-gathering, or other applications where speed of response is vital.\n\nTopSat received the Aviation and Space Grand Award \u2013 the top award for aerospace technology, from Popular Science, the best selling science and technology magazine in the world. The magazine\u2019s editors concluded that TopSat is an innovation that has the potential to change satellite and space reconnaissance technology.\n\nTopSat weighs just 120 kg, but carries an optical camera capable of delivering panchromatic images with a spatial resolution at nadir of 2.8 metres covering a 17x17 km area, and simultaneous three-band multi-spectral images, (red, green, blue), with a resolution of 5.6 metres. This is thought to represent the best resolution per mass of any satellite launched to date. This camera is integrated with an agile micro-satellite platform to permit pitch compensation manoeuvres, allowing imaging of low illumination scenes.\n\nTopSat has been in operation since its launch from Plesetsk in Russia on 27th October 2005. The satellite can be reprogrammed in orbit, and the consortium is exploiting this to enhance its performance. In addition to actively pursuing experiments for the MOD and BNSC, the consortium is also seeking new applications to which the technology can be applied. In the future, a constellation of three or four TopSat satellites could image almost any point on the Earth at least once a day, further opening up the potential for quick response imagery which is extremely cost effective to deliver.\n\n[Information from QinetiQ Ltd.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: TOPSAT\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: TOPSAT\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.1\n      Period: 98.6\n      Repeat_Cycle: 4\n      Perigee: 688.4\n      Apogee: 714\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-18\n   Online_Resource: http://www.qinetiq.com/home/defence/defence_solutions/space/topsat.html\n   Online_Resource: http://earth.esa.int/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=5135\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2005-10-27\n      Launch_Site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia\n      Primary_Sponsor: QinetiQ Ltd.\n      Primary_Sponsor: Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.

Twenty-five years after the rollout of the first meteorological satellite in 1977, some six other Meteosats later, MSG is now a completely new series of geostationary meteorological satellites with three pieces already being produced and others that may follow within the next decade.\n\nMSG is a joint project between ESA and Eumetsat, the organization set up in 1986 to establish, maintain and operate a European system of meteorological satellites. Three satellites are planned at present and a ground segment. ESA is responsible for designing and developing the first satellite - now already in orbit - and for procuring the other three on behalf of Eumetsat. Eumetsat is responsible for defining the payload based on user needs, procuring the ground segment and launchers, and operating the system.\n\nWith the launch of MSG-2, at any one time, two MSG satellites will be functional in geostationary orbit, the operational one being at 0 degrees longitude which is above equatorial west Africa, the other being on stand-by with 10 degrees of separation.\n\nThe first satellite, MSG-1 has been launched on board an Ariane 5 launcher in\nAugust 2002. MSG-2 will follow later. MSG-3 will be built and put in storage\nuntil it is required to take over as the operational MSG nears the end of its\nlife. Each satellite will have a nominal seven-year lifetime. A fourth MSG\nsatellite of the same design is foreseen to ensure continuity of service until\nthe end of the next decade.\n\nAdditional information can be found at \"http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/MSG/\"\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: MSG\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: METEOSAT\n      Short_Name: MSG\n      Long_Name: Meteosat Second Generation\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Meteosat-9\n      Short_Name: Meteosat-8\n      Short_Name: MSG-1\n      Short_Name: MSG-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: GERB\n      Short_Name: SEVIRI\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 35,800 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 0 degrees\n      Orbit_Type: GEO > Geosynchronous > Geostationary\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-29\n   Online_Resource: http://www.esa.int/esaMI/MSG/SEMQSCULWFE_0.html\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2005-12-25\n      Launch_Site: Kourou, French Guiana\n      Design_Life: 7 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: EUMETSAT\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The first Meteosat, Meteosat-1, was launched in 1977, and the last of the first generation, Meteosat-7, was launched 20 years later, in 1997.\n\nMore Information:\nhttp://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/MeteosatFirstGeneration/index.htm?l=en\n\nMeteosat Second Generation (MSG) consists of a series of four geostationary meteorological satellites, along with ground-based infrastructure, that will operate consecutively until 2020. The MSG satellites carry an impressive pair of instruments, the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI), which has the capacity to observe the Earth in 12 spectral channels and provide image data which is core to operational forecasting needs, and the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instrument supporting climate studies.\n\nMore Information: \nhttp://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/MeteosatSecondGeneration/MissionOverview/index.htm?l=en\n\n\nThe Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) system is being established through cooperation between EUMETSAT and the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA has already contributed to the initial research and development of the new satellites. The first MTG-I and MTG-S prototypes are being developed by ESA as part of its MTG programme. The EUMETSAT MTG programme includes the procurement of the four recurrent satellites - three MTG-Is and one additional MTG-S - as well as six launches, the development of the ground segment and the operations of all satellites.\n\nThe Euronews video (right) provides a useful introduction to past and future developments in European satellite meteorology, with particular reference to the MTG programme.\nThe MTG series will comprise six satellites, with the first spacecraft likely to be ready for launch from 2017. The in orbit configuration will consist of two parallel positioned satellites, the MTG-I (imager) and the MTG-S (sounder) platforms. Unlike the  first and second generation Meteosat series, MTG will be based on three axes stabilised platforms having the advantage that the instruments are 100% of their in orbit time pointed to the Earth.  Such improvements are necessary to achieve compliance with more demanding user requirements on spatial resolution, repeat cycle and signal to noise ratio, and are a prerequisite to conduct soundings from geostationary orbit.\nMTG-I satellites will fly the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and an imaging lightning detection instrument the Lightning Imager (LI). The MTG-S will include an interferometer the InfraRed Sounder (IRS) with hyper-spectral resolution in the thermal spectral domain, and the Sentinel-4 instrument, the high resolution Ultraviolet Visible Near-infrared (UVN) spectrometer.\nThe programme should guarantee access to space-acquired meteorological data until at least the late 2030s.\n\nhttp://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/MeteosatThirdGeneration/index.htm?l=en\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: METEOSAT\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: METEOSAT\n      Short_Name: METEOSAT\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/MeteosatFirstGeneration/index.htm?l=en\n   Online_Resource: http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/MeteosatSecondGeneration/MissionOverview/index.htm?l=en\n   Online_Resource: http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/MeteosatThirdGeneration/index.htm?l=en\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1977-12-09\n      Primary_Sponsor: ESA\n      Primary_Sponsor: EUMETSAT\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

                                "description": "ROCSat-2 is an NSPO (National Space Program Office) of Taiwan Earth imaging satellite with the objective to collect high-resolution panchromatic (2 m) and multispectral (8 m) imagery for a great variety of applications such as in land use, agriculture and forestry, environmental monitoring, natural disaster evaluation, and in support of research interests, in particular with the ISUAL instrument. Daily image coverage of Taiwan and the surrounding region is required.\n\nBackground: A contract was signed in May 1999 between NSPO and DASA/DSS (Dornier Satelliten Systeme GmbH) of Germany to build a high-resolution optical imaging satellite. However, the German government refused to give DASA/DSS an export licence for the S/C (the People's Republic of China was protesting the deal). The stalemate was resolved in Dec. 1999 when NSPO signed a new contract with MMS (now Astrium SAS of France). Quick approval of the export of ROCSat-2 was provided by the French government. The ROCSat program is part of a long-term effort in Taiwan to develop an autonomous space capability.\n\nNote: A public naming competition took place in Taiwan in 2004 with regard to the ROCSat satellite program. At the end of this contest, the ROCSat program was given the new name of FormoSat in December 2004. Hence, ROCSat-2 became FormoSat-2. \n\nSpacecraft:\n\nThe spacecraft bus has been built by EADS Astrium SAS (prime contractor) of V\u00e9lizy, France, based on the Leostar 500 XO family. There were also contributions from Taiwanese industry (including satellite computers, S-band antennas, and sun sensors). The S/C structure consists basically of a hexagonal body of 1.6 m side length (diameter), 2.4 m in height. The satellite is three-axis stabilized. The upper deck of the platform carries the payload (RSI and ISUAL) and also part of AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem), namely the star sensors and gyroscopes. The lower deck carries the four reaction wheels and the autonomous propulsion module. The pointing accuracy is &lt; 0.7 km (0.12\u00ba); the position knowledge is &lt; 70 m (0.02\u00ba). The fixed solar array uses GaAs cells and consists of two deployable flaps. The entire S/C architecture is designed in such a way as to provide a low roll inertia, a key factor for satellite agility and instrument line-of-sight stability. The S/C provides a body-pointing capability of \u00b145\u00ba in roll and pitch (45\u00ba pitch in 60 s, 10\u00ba roll in 25 s, 30\u00ba roll in 60 s, respectively). The S/C wet mass is about 746 kg with 81 kg of propellant (N2H4) mass. The design life is five years or better.\n\nLaunch: A launch of ROCSat-2 took place on May 20, 2004 (UTC) on a Taurus-XL vehicle of OSC (Orbital Sciences Corporation) from VAFB, CA (maiden flight of Taurus-XL configuration which offers greater lift capability compared to previous versions of the Taurus rocket).\n\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, mean altitude = 888 km, inclination = 99.14\u00ba, period of 102.9 minutes, the LTDN (Local Time of Descending Node) is 9:26 AM (14 orbits/day). The agility of the spacecraft provides a daily revisit capability for event/disaster monitoring.\n\nNote: Following the early-orbit checkout, the initial satellite orbit has been raised from 728 km to 888 km altitude in the period May 23 to June 2, 2004. A total of 32 burns were performed by the propulsion module with 4 burns for inclination change, to enter into the mission orbit with an altitude of 891 km and an inclination of 99.14\u00ba.\n\nGround segment: The basic elements of the ROCSat-2 ground segment are the MMC (Multi Mission Center) and the XAS (X-band Acquisition System) located in Hsinchu, Taiwan. MMC in turn consists of MOC (Mission Operations Center), MCC (Mission Control Center), SCC (Science Control Center), FDF (Flight Dynamics Facility), and GCN (Ground Communications Network). ROCSat-2 X-band imagery reception is also made available to third parties (international partners) with their own ground stations through cooperative agreements.\n\nMission status: The spacecraft and its payload are operating nominally as of 2007.\n\nMission operations started in June 2004 (the checkout and performance verification for satellite bus and RSI were started on May 21 and completed through June 2004; all performance requirements of FormoSat-2 had been successfully verified in orbit). Besides providing imagery for the domestic needs of Taiwan, the S/C is frequently being used to deliver high-resolution imagery for event monitoring (coverage of the Tsunami in Asia on Dec. 26, 2004 and thereafter, coverage of Hurricane Katarina in Aug. 2005, coverage of Typhoons on the Pacific, coverage of earthquake regions, etc.). The spacecraft is operating nominally as of 2006. 7) 8) 9) 10)\n\n\u2022 NSPO has contracted to SPOT Image S.A. for the international distribution of FORMOSAT-2 images since June 2004\n\n\u2022 On 4 July 2004, ISUAL successfully observed the first images of sprites, sprite halo, and elves.\n\n\u2022 In April 2005, NSPO implemented a terminal in Kiruna, Sweden, to serve as an additional receiving station\n\n\u2022 In May 2006, NSPO implemented a F2T (FormoSat-2 Terminal) in Svalbard, Norway, to extend the data acquisition capability of the mission.\n\nSOH (State-of-Health) trending during two years of mission operations (May 2004-May 2006) on five major subsystems, including AOCS and EPS (Electric Propulsion Subsystem), and one major payload have been conducted. All parameters were well within specifications. The C&amp;DH and the TT&amp;C do not exhibit any SOH problems so far.\n\nRSI (Remote Sensing Instrument), built by EADS Astrium SAS, France. RSI is made up of the camera and IPU (Instrument Processing Unit). The camera itself consists of the optical subassembly, the secondary structure, and the FPA (Focal Plane Assembly). The Korsch telescope (mirrors &amp; structure) design and the focal plane structure are being made of SiC (Silicon Carbide). The video electronics, sequencer, DC/DC converter, and compression cards comprise the IPU.\n\nRSI utilizes the agility of the satellite bus for stereo imaging over a specific region, continuous imaging over a slender region, and mosaic imaging over a large region. The imaging capability is 8 minutes per orbit, and the imaging areas during one cycle can be one 3000 km x 24 km continuous strip, two 100 km x 24 km stereo pairs, four 100 km x 24 km strips, or eight scenes.\n\nISUAL (Imager of Sprites: Upper Atmospheric Lightning). ISUAL is a joint international research program of NSPO, UCB (University of California at Berkeley), National Cheng Kung University of Taiwan, and Tohoku University, Japan. The objective is to observe the natural upward lightning discharge phenomena toward the ionosphere on top of the troposphere, referred to as TLEs (Transient Luminous Events). The requirements call for: 14)\n\n\u2022 To determine the location and timing of luminous phenomena above thunder clouds to investigate their spatial, temporal and spectral properties\n\n\u2022 To obtain a global survey of upper atmospheric optical flash transients (sprites, elves, blue jets, gigantic jets, etc.).\n\nThe instrument consists of four elements: a) intensified sprite imager, b) a six-channel spectrophotometer, c) a two-channel array photometer, and d) an electronics package. The imager is a staring-type frame CCD camera, taking 180 frames/s with a resolution of 512 x 80 pixels in a FOV of 20\u00ba x 3.15\u00ba. In Figure 8, the large disk of the ISUAL instrument contains six color filters, which can be rotated to select wavelength for measuring the emission spectrum of red sprites. ISUAL is operated in three modes:\n\n\u2022 The sprite continuous mode to take images with a sample rate of 100 Hz\n\n\u2022 The sprite burst mode with a sample rate of 1000 Hz\n\n\u2022 The auroral mode at a constant rate of 1 sample/s. \n\nInformation obtained from http://www.eoportal.org/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: FORMOSAT-2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: FORMOSAT-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: ROCSat-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n      Short_Name: MS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 888 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 99.14 degrees\n      Equator_Crossing: 9:30 am\n      Period: 103 minutes\n      Repeat_Cycle: 1\n      Orbit_Type: LEO &gt; Low Earth Orbit &gt; Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-09\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nspo.org.tw/2008e/projects/project2/intro.htm\n   Online_Resource: http://www.spotimage.com/web/en/977--formosat-2-images.php\n   Online_Resource: http://www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/formosat-2.html\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2004-05-20\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Design_Life: 5 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: National Space Program Office (NSPO), China\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

CBERS-4A will be used to monitor water resources, agriculture, urban growth, and land use, with a large focus on the preservation of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nQuick facts : Overview\nMission type: EO\nAgency: CRESDA, INPE\nMission status: Operational (nominal)\nLaunch date: 20 Dec 2019\nMeasurement domain: Land\nMeasurement category: Multi-purpose imagery (land), Surface temperature (land), Vegetation, Albedo and reflectance, Landscape topography\nMeasurement detailed: Land surface imagery, Vegetation type, Earth surface albedo, Land surface temperature, Land surface topography\nInstruments: DCS, WFI (CBERS-4A), WPM, MUX (CBERS-4A), IRMSS-2\nInstrument type: maging multi-spectral radiometers (vis/IR), High resolution optical imagers, Data collection\n\nSummary\nMission Capabilities\n\nCBERS-4A has three imaging instruments on board:\n\n    a high-resolution optical imager - Multispectral and Panchromatic Wide-Scan Camera (WPM);\n    as well as two different multi-spectral radiometers, a Multispectral Camera (MUX) and a Wide Field Imager (WFI).\n\nThe data is used to monitor water resources, agriculture, urban growth and land use, with a large focus on controlling the deforestation and burning of the Amazon rainforest. The addition of CBERS-4A to the satellites observing Brazil is beneficial due to the high frequency of clouds in the Amazon region; the more satellites observing the area, the higher the chance of uninterrupted images. The data collected will be of large use to the national programs of Brazil, Prodes (measurement of deforestation by remote sensing) and Deter (Brazilian real-time deforestation detection).\nPerformance Specifications\n\nAll three instruments measure over three visible bands (blue, green, red) and one near infrared (NIR) band. WPM also observes over one panchromatic band with a spatial resolution of 2 m, and a resolution of 8 m for the visible and NIR bands. It has a swath width of 92 km. MUX has a resolution of 16 m and a swath width of 95 km, while WFI has a resolution of 55 m and a swath width of 684 km.\n\nCBERS-4A undertakes a sun-synchronous orbit with an altitude of 629 km and an inclination of 97.9\u00b0. The satellite has a period of 97.3 minutes and a repeat cycle of 31 days.\nSpace and Hardware Components\n\nThe 1,730 kg satellite CBERS-4A was launched onboard a Long March 4B (LM-4B) launch vehicle from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Complex in Shanxi, China.",

The GRACE mission has two identical spacecrafts flying about 220 kilometers apart in a polar orbit 500 kilometers above the Earth. \n\nIt maps the Earth's gravity fields by making accurate measurements of the distance between the two satellites, using geodetic quality Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and a microwave ranging system. This provides scientists from all over the world with an efficient and cost-effective way to map the Earth's gravity fields with unprecedented accuracy. The results from this mission yield crucial information about the distribution and flow of mass within the Earth and it's surroundings.\n\nThe gravity variations that GRACE studies include: changes due to surface and deep currents in the ocean; runoff and ground water storage on land masses; exchanges between ice sheets or glaciers and the oceans; and variations of mass within the Earth. Another goal of the mission is to create a better profile of the Earth's atmosphere.

Building upon the success of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), it will initiate the measurement of global precipitation, a key climate factor. Its science objectives are: to improve ongoing efforts to predict climate by providing near-global measurement of precipitation, its distribution, and physical processes; to improve the accuracy of weather and precipitation forecasts through more accurate measurement of rain rates and latent heating; and to provide more frequent and complete sampling of the Earth's precipitation. GPM Constellation is envisioned to consist of a core spacecraft to measure precipitation structure and to provide a calibration standard for the constellation spacecraft, an international constellation of NASA and contributed spacecraft to provide frequent precipitation measurements on a global basis, calibration/validation sites distributed globally with a broad array of precipitation-measuring instrumentation, and a global precipitation data system to produce and distribute global rain maps and climate research products.\n\nThe GPM Core Observatory carries the first space-borne Ku/Ka-band Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and a multi-channel GPM Microwave Imager (GMI). The DPR instrument, which provides three dimensional measurements of precipitation structure over 78 and 152 mile (125 and 245 km) swaths, consists of a Ka-band precipitation radar (KaPR) operating at 35.5 GHz and a Ku-band precipitation radar (KuPR) operating at 13.6 GHz. Relative to the TRMM precipitation radar, the DPR is more sensitive to light rain rates and snowfall. In addition, simultaneous measurements by the overlapping of Ka/Ku-bands of the DPR can provide new information on particle drop size distributions over moderate precipitation intensities. In addition, by providing new microphysical measurements from the DPR to complement cloud and aerosol observations, GPM is expected to provide further insights into how precipitation processes may be affected by human activities.\n\nThe GMI instrument is a conical-scanning multi-channel microwave radiometer covering a swath of 550 miles (885 km) with thirteen channels ranging in frequency from 10 GHz to 183 GHz. The GMI uses a set of frequencies that have been optimized over the past two decades to retrieve heavy, moderate and light precipitation using the polarization difference at each channel as an indicator of the optical thickness and water content.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GPM\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: GPM\n      Long_Name: Global Precipitation Measurement\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: GMI\n      Short_Name: DPR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Non-Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2009-02-25\n   Online_Resource: https://pmm.nasa.gov/GPM\n   Online_Resource: http://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gpm/index.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/GPM/index_e.htm\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2014-01-25\n      Launch_Site: TANEGASHIMA ISLAND, JAPAN\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: JAPAN/JAXA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

In fact it uses advanced\nmicrowave techniques to collect global measurements and images (much\nof the data are collected from remote areas such as the southern\noceans and the Antarctic) independently of time of day and weather\nconditions. It also undertakes the measurement of many parameters that\nare not covered by existing satellite systems, including those of sea\nstate, sea surface winds, ocean circulation and sea/ice levels.\n\nSatellite characteristics:\n\n--------\nPlatform: based on the SPOT Multimission Platform\nPower supply: 4 x 24 Ah batteries; 1.8 kW from solar array\nAttitude control:  3-axis stabilised earth pointing, with\noption of 9.5 degrees offset in Roll-Tilt Mode (RTM)\nTotal mass:  2400 kg (at beginning of mission)\nOverall length: 11.8 m\nSolar array: 11.7 m x 2.4 m\nSAR antenna: 10.0 m x 1.0 m\nScatterometer antennas: fore/aft 3.6 m x 0.25 m; mid: 2.3 m\nx 0.35 m\nRadar Altimeter antenna: 1.2 m diameter\nDesign lifetime: 2-3 years\n---------\n\nERS-1 carries on-board a number of instruments consisting of a core\nset of active microwave sensors supported by additional, complementary\ninstruments: the Active Microwave Instrument (AMI), which combines a\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) operating in image or wave mode and a\nwind scatterometer, the Radar Altimeter (RA), the Along-Track Scanning\nRadiometer and Microwave Sounder (ATSR), the Precise Range and\nRange-rate Equipment (PRARE) and Laser Retroreflectors (LRR).\n\nThe primary objective of the ERS-1 mission is the monitoring of oceans\nand sea ice providing essential data for:\n\n- improved representation of oceans/atmosphere interactions\nin climatic models\n- major advances in the knowledge of ocean circulation and\ntransfer of energy\n- more reliable estimates of the mass balance of the Arctic\nand Antarctic ice sheets\n- better monitoring of pollution and dynamic coastal\nprocesses\n- improved detection and management of land use change\n\n\nThe ability of ERS-1 to acquire vast global data sets of ocean,\natmosphere, ice and land phenomena contributes to the following fields\nof study:\n\n\n- Ocean/Ice: ocean circulation, global wind/wave\nrelationships, sea ice and iceberg monitoring, etc.\n- Physical Earth: accurate determination of the ocean\ngeoid, forestry, glaciology, geology and agriculture\nstudies, etc.\n- Climate: contribution to the World Climate Research\nProgramme and to the World Ocean Circulation Experiment\n- Weather and Sea: short and medium-term weather\nforecasting, sea surface state forecasting, wind speed and\ndirection, location of pelagic fish through the monitoring\nof temperature fronts\n\nRelation between ERS-1 instruments and mission\nobjectives\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWeather forecasting: AMI wind mode\nSea-state forecasting: AMI, wave and wind modes\nOffshore activity: Altimeter, ATSR, AMI in wave and wind\nmodes\nShip routing: Altimeter, ATSR, AMI in wave and wind modes\nFisheries (fish location):  (Altimeter), (ATSR), AMI in\nwind mode\nSea and iceberg monitoring:  Altimeter, ATSR, AMI in image\nmode\nOil and pollution detection: ATSR, AMI in image mode\nCoastal process: ATSR, AMI in image mode\nLand applications: (Altimeter), ATSR\nOcean circulation: Altimeter(1), ATSR, (AMI in wave mode)\nOcean tides: Altimeter(2)\nWind fields(3): Altimeter, AMI (in image mode), in wave and\nwind mode\nWave fields(3): Altimeter, AMI (in image mode), in wave and\nwind mode\nPolar oceans: Altimeter, ATSR, AMI in all modes.\nLand ice: Altimeter, AMI (in image mode)\nSea-surface temperature: ATSR\nMarine biology: (ATSR)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n( ) indicates limited applicability\n\n(1) For large-scale circulation, accurate orbit\ndetermination over short arcs is required\n\n(2) For solar tides, measurements from other satellites in\ncomplementary orbits are required\n\n(3) The altimeter and active microwave instrumentation are\nmutually supportive in deriving the wind and wave fields\n\nThe complexity of the ERS-1 mission, which effectively consists of a\ncombination of several different missions, requires a very careful\napproach when planning the mission operations. Taking into account the\ndifferent mission objectives, and attempting to satisfy them in a\nquasi-optimal way in the course of ERS-1's lifetime, has held to the\ndefinition of phases of activity during the mission:\n\n\n- Phase 0: Orbit acquisition, initial switch-on and\nfunctional check-out (2 weeks after the launch)\n- Phase A: The Commisioning phase, using a 3 day repeat\ncycle (25 July 1991-10 December 1991)\n- Phase B : The first ice phase, using a 3 day repeat cycle\n (28 December 1991-1 April 1992)\n- Phase R: The Roll-Tilt phase, using a 35 day repeat cycle\n (2 April 1992-14 April 1992)\n- Phase C: The first multi-disciplinary phase, using a 35\nday repeat cycle\n (14 April 1992-23 December 1993)\n- Phase D: The second ice phase, using a 3 day repeat cycle\n (23 December 1993-10 April 1994)\n- Phase E: The first geodetic phase, using a 172 day repeat\ncycle\n (10 April 1994-28 September 1994)\n- Phase F: The second Geodetic Phase, using a 172 day\nrepeat cycle\n (28 September 1994-21 March 1995)\n- Phase G: The second Multi-Disciplinary Phase, using a 35\nday repeat cycle\n (21 March 1995-10 March 2000)\n\nIn the first half of April 1992, the satellite was operated in a\nRoll-tilt-mode (RTM) to allow SAR imaging at a different view\nangle. In fact by rotating the satellite body around its velocity\nvector (so-called 'Roll-tilt mode') the angle at which all the\ninstruments look at the Earth can be varied. This allows\nexperimentation with the SAR at an incidence angle of 35 degrees\ninstead of the standard 23 degrees, thereby permitting analysis of a\ntotally different set of signatures from objects on the Earth's\nsurface, including in particular vegetation.\n\nRelated URL:\n\nThe ERS Missions: http://earth.esa.int/ers\n\nERS-1 Design: http://earth.esa.int/ers/satconc\n\nFor any query, please refer to:\n\nESA/ESRIN Earth Observation Help Desk\n\nhttp://earth.esa.int\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: ERS-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: ERS Earth Resource Satellite\n      Short_Name: ERS-1\n      Long_Name: European Remote Sensing Satellite-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: ERS-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: ATSR\n      Short_Name: RA\n      Short_Name: SAR\n      Short_Name: AMI\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 782 to 785 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.52 deg\n      Period: 100 min\n      Repeat_Cycle: 3-day, 35-day and 176-day\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-09-14\n   Online_Resource: http://earth.esa.int/ers/satconc/\n   Online_Resource: http://earth.esa.int/ers/\n   Online_Resource: http://www.astronautix.com/craft/ers12.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://earth.esa.int/icons/eeo/_ers-1_fully_deployed.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1991-07-17\n      Launch_Site: Kourou, French Guiana\n      Design_Life: 2-3 YRS\n      Primary_Sponsor: ESA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The mission consists of an only phase (phase A),\nusing a 35 day repeat cycle, from 21 April 1995 to the present.\n\nERS-2 is almost identical to the European Remote Sensing Satellite\nERS-1 launched in 1991.  ERS-2 is capable of measuring, on a global\nscale, the Earth's atmospheric and surface properties with a high\ndegree of accuracy. In fact it uses advanced microwave techniques to\ncollect global measurements and images (much of the data are collected\nfrom remote areas such as the southern oceans and the Antarctic)\nindependent of time of day and weather conditions. It also undertakes\nthe measurements of many parameters not covered by existing satellite\nsystems, including those of sea state, sea surface winds, ocean\ncirculation and sea and ice levels.\n\nERS-2 carries on-board a number of instruments consisting of a core\nset of active microwave sensors supported by additional, complementary\ninstruments: the Active Microwave Instrument (AMI), which combines a\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) operating in image or wave mode and a\nwind scatterometer, the Radar Altimeter (RA), the Along-Track Scanning\nRadiometer and Microwave Sounder (ATSR-2), the Precise Range and\nRange-rate Equipment (PRARE), the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment\n(GOME), and Laser Retroreflectors (LRR).\n\nThe primary objectives of the ERS-2 mission are the monitoring of the\noceans and sea ice providing essential data for:\n\n- improved representation of oceans/atmosphere interactions\nin climatic models\n- major advances in the knowledge of ocean circulation and\ntransfer of energy\n- more reliable estimates of the mass balance of the Arctic\nand Antarctic ice sheets\n- better monitoring of pollution and dynamic coastal\nprocesses\n- improved detection and management of land use change.\n\nThe capability of ERS-2 to acquire vast global data sets of ocean,\natmosphere, ice and land phenomena contributes to the following types\nof study and application:\n\n- Ocean/Ice: ocean circulation, global wind/wave\nrelationships, sea ice and iceberg monitoring, etc.\n- Physical Earth: accurate determination of the ocean\ngeoid, forestry, glaciology, geology and agriculture\nstudies, etc.\n- Climate: contribution to the World Climate Research\nProgramme and to the World Ocean Circulation Experiment\n- Weather and Sea: short and medium-term weather\nforecasting, sea surface State Forecasting wind speed and\ndirection, location of pelagic fish through the monitoring\nof temperature fronts\n- Global Ozone: measures ozone, trace gases, and aerosols\nin the troposphere and stratosphere\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: ERS-2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: ERS Earth Resource Satellite\n      Short_Name: ERS-2\n      Long_Name: European Remote Sensing Satellite-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: ERS-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: LRR\n      Short_Name: GOME\n      Short_Name: PRARE\n      Short_Name: ATSR-2\n      Short_Name: RA\n      Short_Name: SAR\n      Short_Name: AMI\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 785 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.5 deg\n      Repeat_Cycle: 35 day\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-09-19\n   Online_Resource: http://earth.esa.int/ers/\n   Online_Resource: http://www.astronautix.com/craft/ers12.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/polar/satgifs/ers1.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1995-04-21\n      Launch_Site: Kourou, French Guiana\n      Primary_Sponsor: ESA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

It was launched on\nJuly 23, 1972, the first satellite of the United States&#039; Landsat program. The\nnear-polar orbiting spacecraft served as a stabilized, Earth-oriented platform\nfor obtaining information on agricultural and forestry resources, geology and\nmineral resources, hydrology and water resources, geography, cartography,\nenvironmental pollution, oceanography and marine resources, and meteorological\nphenomena.\n\nTo accomplish these objectives, the spacecraft was equipped with (1) a\nthree-camera return beam vidicon (RBV) to obtain visible light and near\ninfrared photographic images of Earth, (2) a four-channel multispectral scanner\n(MSS) to obtain radiometric images of Earth, and (3) a data collection system\n(DCS) to collect information from remote, individually equipped ground stations\nand to relay the data to central acquisition stations. Landsat 1 carried two\nwide-band video tape recorders (WBVTR) capable of storing up to 30 min of\nscanner or camera data to give the spacecraft&#039;s sensors a near-global coverage\ncapability.\n\nAn advanced attitude control system consisting of horizon scanners, sun\nsensors, and a command antenna combined with a freon gas propulsion system\npermitted the spacecraft&#039;s orientation to be maintained within plus or minus\n0.7 degrees in all three axes. Spacecraft communications included a command\nsubsystem operating at 154.2 and 2106.4 MHz and a PCM narrow-band telemetry\nsubsystem, operating at 2287.5 and 137.86 MHz, for spacecraft housekeeping,\nattitude, and sensor performance data. Video data from the three-camera RBV\nsystem was transmitted in both real-time and tape recorder modes at 2265.5 MHz,\nwhile information from the MSS was constrained to a 20 MHz rf bandwidth at\n2229.5 MHz.\n\nIn 1976, Landsat 1 discovered a tiny uninhabited island 20 km off the eastern\ncoast of Canada. This island was thereafter designated Landsat Island after the\nsatellite. As of 2006, it is the only island to be discovered via satellite\nimagery.\n\nThe spacecraft was turned off on January 6, 1978, when cumulative precession of\nthe orbital plane caused the spacecraft to see almost constant sunlight which\nled to overheating.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: LANDSAT-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: LANDSAT\n      Short_Name: LANDSAT-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MSS\n      Short_Name: RBV\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 917 km (570 mi)\n      Orbit_Inclination: 99.2 degree\n      Equator_Crossing: 9:30 AM +/- 15 minutes\n      Period: 103 minutes\n      Repeat_Cycle: 18 days\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-01\n   Online_Resource: https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-1/\n   Online_Resource: https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-1\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1972-07-23\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg AFB\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USGS\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The satellite, primarily devoted to Earth observation, was in a highly\nelliptical initial orbit with a 272 km perigee and an 148,228 km apogee. The\norbital inclination was 31.1 degrees. The satellite took 3796 minutes to\ncomplete one orbit. Two experiments aboard OGO-5 produced cosmic high- energy\nresults, although their intended target was the Sun. The spacecraft attitude\ncontrol failed on 6 August 1971 and it was placed in a standby mode on 8\nOctober 1971. Three experiments (none of which were related to cosmic\nhigh-energy detection) were reactivated from 1 June to 13 July 1972. Operation\nof OGO 5 terminated completely on 14 July 1972.\n\nThe Anderson et al. (University of California, Berkeley) Energetic Radiations\nfrom Solar Flares experiment was operational from March 1968 - June 1971.\nPrimarily devoted to solar observations, it detected at least 11 cosmic X-ray\nbursts in time coincidence with gamma-ray bursts seen by other instruments. The\ndetector was a 0.5 cm thick NaI(Tl) crystal with a 9.5 sq-cm area. Data were\naccumulated into energy ranges of: 9.6-19.2, 19.2-32, 32-48, 48-64, 64-80,\n80-104, 104-128, and > 128 keV. The data were sampled for 1. 15 seconds once\nevery 2.3 seconds.\n\nThe gamma-ray instrument on-board, sensitive to energies from 25-100 MeV, was a\nsix gap spark chamber with an effective area of ~ 100 sq-cm. It was called the\nEnergetic Photons in Primary Cosmic Rays experiment (Hutchinson et al.,\nSouthampton University). It had an angular resolution of ~ 30 degrees (FWHM).\nThe satellite was Earth-pointing and passed regularly through the radiation\nbelts, which led to severe restrictions on the sky regions which could be\nexamined by the gamma-ray instrument. Other problems, such as an efficiency\nreduction in the anti-coincidence shield and data system difficulties, severely\ndegraded the scientific return from the experiment. Data collection ceased\naltogether after 5 months. Gamma-ray emission from the galactic plane was\nmonitored. No point sources were detected.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: OGO-5\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: OGO (Orbiting Geophysical Observatory)\n      Short_Name: OGO-5\n      Long_Name: Orbiting Geophysical Observatory-5\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: OGO-E\n      Short_Name: 03138\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MAGNETOMETERS\n      Short_Name: SPECTROMETERS\n      Short_Name: GAMMA RADIATION DETECTOR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 31.1 degrees\n      Repeat_Cycle: 3796 minutes\n      Perigee: 272 km\n      Apogee: 148,228 km\n      Orbit_Type: HEO > Highly Elliptical Orbit\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-13\n   Online_Resource: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/ogo.html\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1968-014A\n   Sample_Image: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/ogo/ogo.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1968-03-04\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

                                        "description": "OGO 2 was a large observatory instrumented with 20 experiments designed to make simultaneous, correlative observations of aurora and airglow emissions, energetic particles, magnetic field variations, ionospheric properties, etc., especially over the polar areas. OGO 2 consisted of a main body, generally parallelepipedal in form, two rectangular solar panels, each with a solar-oriented experiment package (SOEP), and two orbital plane experiment packages (OPEP). It also included six experiment packages (EP-1,-2,-3,-4,-5, and -6) mounted on booms extending generally fore and aft of the spacecraft along the Y axis. Antenna and attitude control fixtures also extended from separate and/or EP booms. The main body was attitude-controlled by use of horizon scanners and gas jets and was designed to point toward the earth (Z axis). The axis connecting the two solar panels (X axis) was designed to oscillate in order to remain perpendicular to the earth-sun-spacecraft plane. The solar panels activated by sun sensors could rotate about this X axis in order to obtain maximum radiation for the solar cells and concurrently orient the SOEP properly. The OPEPs were reoriented on either end of an axis that was parallel to the Z axis and attached to the forward end of the main body. These OPEP sensors normally were maintained looking forward in the orbital plane of the satellite. To maintain this orientation, the OPEP axis could rotate over 90 deg. In addition, an angular difference of over 90 deg was possible between the orientation of the upper and lower OPEP packages. The SOEP contained four experiments, and the OPEP contained five experiments. Soon after achieving orbit, difficulties in maintaining earth lock with horizon scanners caused exhaustion of attitude control gas by October 23, 1965, 10 days after launch. At this time, the spacecraft entered a spin mode (about 0.11 rpm) with a large coning angle about the previously vertical axis. Five experiments became useless when the satellite went into this spin mode. Six additional experiments were degraded by this loss of attitude control. By April 1966, both batteries had failed, so subsequent observations were limited to sunlit portions of the orbit. By December 1966, only eight experiments were operational, five of which were not degraded by the spin mode operation. By April 1967, the tape recorders had malfunctioned and only one third of the recorded data could be processed. Spacecraft power and periods of operational scheduling conflicts created six large data gaps so that data were observed on a total of about 306 days of the 2-yr, 18-day total span of observed satellite data to November 1, 1967. The data gaps were (a) October 24, 1965, to November 5, 1965, (b) December 6, 1965, to January 7, 1966, (c) April 9, 1966, to June 21, 1966, (d) September 2, 1966, to November 18, 1966, (e) December 27, 1966, to April 11, 1967, and (f) May 9, 1967, to September 19, 1967. The spacecraft was shut down on November 1, 1967, with eight experiments still operational. It was reactivated for 2 weeks in February 1968 to operate experiment 65-081A-05. \n\n[Summary provided by NASA.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: OGO-2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: OGO (Orbiting Geophysical Observatory)\n      Short_Name: OGO-2\n      Long_Name: Orbiting Geophysical Observatory-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: OGO-C\n      Short_Name: POGO 1\n      Short_Name: 01620\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SPECTROMETERS\n      Short_Name: MAGNETOMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 87.4 degrees\n      Period: 104.0 minutes\n      Perigee: 414.0 km\n      Apogee: 1510.0 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-13\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1965-081A\n   Sample_Image: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/ogo/ogo.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1965-10-14\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Two experiment booms failed to properly\ndeploy, with one of the booms obscuring a horizon scanner's view of earth. As a\nresult, the spacecraft attitude could not be earth oriented and OGO 1 remained\nspin stabilized at 5 rpm. Nevertheless, data from all 20 experiments on board\nwas received, although at a \"less than expected capacity\" from some of them.\nDuring September 1964, acceptable data were received over 70% of the orbital\npath. Spacecraft operation was restricted to Spring and Fall due to power\nsupply limitations. There were 11 such 3-month periods prior to the spacecraft\nbeing put into stand-by mode on 25 November 1969. OGO 1 was completely\nterminated on 1 November 1971.\n\nOn board was the Positron Search and Gamma-Ray Spectrum experiment of Cline et\nal. It was designed to determine whether low-energy (0-3 MeV) positrons are\ntrapped temporarily or permanently in the Van Allen regions and whether\nlow-energy solar and interplanetary positrons exist at the edge of the Earth's\nmagnetic field. A secondary objective was to detect gamma-ray bursts from the\nSun in the energy range 80 keV - 1 MeV. The experiment consisted of 3 CsI\ncrystals surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence shield. The output of the\nwhole unit was monitored by 3 PMTs. Once every 18.5 seconds, integral intensity\nmeasurements were made in each of 16 energy channels which were equally spaced\nover the .08-1 MeV range.\n\nThe experiment did not achieve its goals due to electrical interference and\nsecular degradation of the PMT responses. However, searching back through the\ndata after the discovery of cosmic gamma-ray bursts by the Vela satellites\nrevealed the detection of one or more such events in the OGO 1 data.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: OGO-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: OGO (Orbiting Geophysical Observatory)\n      Short_Name: OGO-1\n      Long_Name: Orbiting Geophysical Observatory-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: EOGO 1\n      Short_Name: OGO-A\n      Short_Name: 00879\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SPECTROMETERS\n      Short_Name: MAGNETOMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 31.2 degrees\n      Period: 3839.0 minutes\n      Perigee: 281.0 km\n      Apogee: 149385.0 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-12\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1964-054A\n   Online_Resource: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/ogo.html#ogo1\n   Sample_Image: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/ogo/ogo.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1964-09-05\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The main\nbody of the spacecraft was attitude controlled by means of horizon scanners and\ngas jets so that its orientation was maintained constant with respect to the\nearth and the sun. The solar panels rotated on a horizontal axis extending\ntransversely through the main body of the spacecraft. The rotation of the\npanels was activated by sun sensors so that the panels received maximum\nsunlight. Seven experiments were mounted on the solar panels (the SOEP\npackage). An additional axis, oriented vertically across the front of the main\nbody, carried seven experiments (the OPEP package). Nominally, these sensors\nobserved in a forward direction in the orbital plane of the satellite. The\nsensors could be rotated more than 90 deg relative to the nominal observing\nposition and more than 90 deg between the upper and lower OPEP groups mounted\non either end of this axis. On June 22, 1969, the spacecraft potential dropped\nsignificantly during sunlight operation and remained so during subsequent\nsunlight operation. This unexplained shift affected seven experiments which\nmade measurements dependent upon knowledge of the spacecraft plasma sheath.\nDuring October 1969, a string of solar cells failed, but the only effect of the\ndecreased power was to cause two experiments to change their mode of operation.\nAlso during October 1969, a combination of manual and automatic attitude\ncontrol was initiated, which extended the control gas lifetime of the attitude\ncontrol system. In August 1970, tape recorder (TR) no. 1 operation degraded, so\nall recorded data were subsequently taken with TR no. 2. By September 1970,\npower and equipment degradation left 14 experiments operating normally, 3\npartially, and 9 off. From October 14, 1970, TR no. 2 was used only on\nWednesdays (world days) to conserve power and extend TR operation. In June\n1971, the number of 'on' experiments decreased from 13 to 7, and on June 28,\n1971, the spacecraft was placed in a spin-stabilized mode about the yaw (Z)\naxis and turned off due to difficulties with spacecraft power. OGO 6 was turned\non again from October 10, 1971, through March 1972, for operation of experiment\n25 by The Radio Research Laboratory, Japan. \n\n[Summary provided by NASA.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: OGO-6\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: OGO (Orbiting Geophysical Observatory)\n      Short_Name: OGO-6\n      Long_Name: Orbiting Geophysical Observatory-6\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: OGO-F\n      Short_Name: PL-691D\n      Short_Name: POGO 3\n      Short_Name: S 60\n      Short_Name: 03986\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MAGNETOMETERS\n      Short_Name: PHOTOMETERS\n      Short_Name: SPECTROMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 82 degrees\n      Period: 99.7 minutes\n      Perigee: 413 km\n      Apogee: 1077 km\n      Orbit_Type: HEO > Highly Elliptical Orbit\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-13\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1969-051A\n   Sample_Image: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/ogo/ogo.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1969-06-05\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

India realized quite early that sustaining its space program in the long run would depend on indigenous technological capabilities (in particular, US export restrictions made this clear). Keeping this in mind, besides building satellites, India embarked as well on satellite launch vehicle development in the early 1970s. As a consequence, India has two very capable launch systems at the start of the 21st century, namely PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) and GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle). 1)\n\nIRS is the integrated LEO (Low Earth Orbit) element of India's NNRMS (National Natural Resources Management System) with the objective to provide a long-term spaceborne operational capability to India for the observation and management of the country's natural resources (applications in agriculture, hydrology, geology, drought and flood monitoring, marine studies, snow studies, and land use). The intend of the program is to create an environment of new perspectives for the Indian research community as a whole, to stimulate the development of new technologies and applications, and to utilize the Earth resources in more meaningful ways.",

It operates in a near polar, sun- synchronous orbit at an altitude of 817km. Its local equatorial crossing time is 10:30 A.M in the descending node. The satellite payload consists of three sensors, namely Panchromatic camera (PAN), Linear Imaging and Self-Scanning Sensor (LISS - III) and Wide Field Sensor (WiFS).\n\nThe PAN camera provides data with a spatial resolution of 5.8m and a ground swath of 70 km at nadir view. This camera can be steered up to +/- 26 degrees, which can be used to acquire stereo pairs and this also improves the revisit capability to 5 days.\n\nLISS - III camera provides multi-spectral data in 4 bands. The spatial resolution for visible (two bands) and near infrared (one band) is 23.5m with a ground swath of 141 km. The fourth band (short wave infrared band) has a spatial resolution of 70.5m with a ground swath of 148 km. The repetivity of LISS - III is 24 days.\n\nWiFS camera collects data in two spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 188m and a ground swath of 810 km. By virtue of its wide swath there is huge side lap between adjacent paths. A repetivity of 3 days can be achieved by suitably combining paths.\n\nThe satellite is equipped with an On Board Tape Recorder (OBTR) with a capacity of 62 Gb, for collecting data outside the visibility region of any ground station. The OBTR was capable of storing data collected for 24 minutes. The OBTR was functional during 1995-1998. \n\n[Summary provided by the Indian Remote Sensing Agency.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: IRS-1C\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: IRS (Indian Remote Sensing Satellite)\n      Short_Name: IRS-1C\n      Long_Name: Indian Remote Sensing Satellite-1C\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: PAN\n      Short_Name: LISS-III\n      Short_Name: WIFS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 817 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.69 deg\n      Equator_Crossing: 10:30 A.M\n      Period: 101.35 min\n      Repeat_Cycle: 24 Days\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-08-12\n   Online_Resource: http://www.isro.gov.in/satellites/irs-1c.aspx\n   Sample_Image: http://www.isro.gov.in/satellites/images/irs1c_img.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1995-05-19\n      Launch_Site: Baikonur Cosmodrome, Tyuratam, Russia\n      Primary_Sponsor: India\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

IRS-1A is the first of a series of semi-operational/ operational remote sensing satellites developed by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for land-based applications such as agriculture,forestry, geology, and hydrology.  The three-axis-stabilized sun-synchronous satellite carries two linear imaging self-scanned sensors (LISS). LISS-1 and LISS-II perform \"pushbroom\" scanning in visible and near IR bands to acquire images of the earth.  Both push-broom scanning sensors operate in the four spectral bands: 0.45-0.52, 0.52-0.59, 0.62-0.68, and 0.77-0.86 micrometer.  Local equatorial crossing time is fixed at around 10 a.m.  The spacecraft platform, measuring 1.56 m x 1.66 m x 1.10 m, has the payload module attached on the top and a deployable solar array stowed on either side.  Attitude control is provided by four momentum wheels, two magnetic torques, and a thruster system. Together these mechanisms provide an estimated accuracy of plus or minus 0.10 deg in all three axes.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: IRS-1A\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: IRS (Indian Remote Sensing Satellite)\n      Short_Name: IRS-1A\n      Long_Name: Indian Remote Sensing Satellite-1A\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: IRS-1A\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: LISS-II\n      Short_Name: LISS-I\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 904 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 99.01 deg\n      Period: 103.1minutes\n      Repeat_Cycle: 22 days\n      Perigee: 863 km\n      Apogee: 917 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-10-05\n   Online_Resource: http://www.isro.gov.in/satellites/irs-1a.aspx\n   Sample_Image: http://www.isro.gov.in/satellites/images/irs1a_img.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1988-03-17\n      Launch_Site: BAIKONUR COSMODROME, TYURATAM, RUSSIA\n      Primary_Sponsor: India\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

One is to collect data on the chemical, microphysical, and optical properties, and spatial and temporal distributions of aerosols. The other is to continue collection of total solar irradiance data for the long-term climate record.\n\nThe Glory mission's scientific objectives are met by implementing two separate science instruments, one with the ability to collect polarimetric measurements along the satellite ground track within the solar reflective spectral region (0.4 to 2.4 micrometers) and one with the ability to monitor changes in sunlight incident on the Earth's atmosphere by collecting high accuracy, high precision measurements of total solar irradiance. Glory accomplishes these objectives by deploying two instruments aboard a low earth orbit satellite, the Aerosol Polarimetry Sensor (APS) and the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM). Additionally, a cloud camera system will provide images that allow the APS scans along the spacecraft ground track to be put into spatial context and to facilitate determination of cloud occurrence within the APS instantaneous field of view.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GLORY\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: GLORY\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: TIM\n      Short_Name: CC GLORY\n      Short_Name: APS GLORY\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 705 km +/- 30 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.2 Degrees +/- 0.15 Degrees\n      Equator_Crossing: 1:35 p.m.\n      Period: 99 Minutes\n      Repeat_Cycle: 16 Days\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-11-09\n   Online_Resource: http://glory.giss.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://glory.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Sample_Image: http://glory.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/gloryinorbit-s.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2011-03-04\n      Launch_Site: VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, USA\n      Design_Life: + 3 years; 5 year goal\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

It\n  was  the  second  (following  GEOS  1)  NASA satellite in the National\n  Geodetic  Satellites  Program.  PAGEOS 1 was made up of 84 gores and 2\n  pole  caps  of  0.0127-mm  aluminized mylar film.  The gores were 48 m\n  long  with  maximum  width  of 1.24 m and the pole caps were 1.02 m in\n  diameter.   The  primary  purpose  of  the  satellite was to provide a\n  tracking  target for geodetic purposes.  It had a specular reflectance\n  of  0.862,  and a diffuse reflectance of 0.029, providing a reflecting\n  light   source   whose   brightness   was  relatively  independent  of\n  observer-satellite-sun   phase   angle.   The  surface  was  also  97%\n  reflectant  for microwave energy in the range from 17 to 4E5 kHz.  The\n  launch,  orbit,  separation,  inflation  and  initial  operation  were\n  nominal,  with  more  than  40  ground  stations  participating in the\n  observation  program.  The orbit was generally considered too high for\n  drag-density  study,  although  some work was done in this area by the\n  Smithsonian   Astrophysical   Observatory.

                                        "description": "he next-generation commercial imaging satellite of DigitalGlobe Inc. (Longmont, CO, USA) is called WorldView-1, a successor of QuickBird-2 (launch Oct. 18, 2001 - and fully operational as of 2007). In Oct. 2003, DigitalGlobe was awarded a sizeable contract by NGA (National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency) of Washington DC, formerly NIMA (National Imaging and Mapping Agency), to provide high-resolution imagery from the next-generation commercial imaging satellites.\n\nThe NGA requirements call for imagery with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m panchromatic and 2 m MS (Multispectral) data. The contract award was made within NGA's NextView program, designed to give the US commercial imaging satellite operators the financing to build their satellites for high-resolution imaging. The WorldView mission is intended to provide imaging services to NGA as well as to the commercial customer base of DigitalGlobe.\n\nSpacecraft:\n\nBATC (Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation) of Boulder, CO, is the prime contractor and integrator of the spacecraft, providing the S/C bus (Ball Commercial Platform BCP-5000) and a WorldView-60 camera. A new feature of the WorldView spacecraft are CMG (Control Moment Gyroscopes) actuators for precise and highly responsive pointing control. The BCP-5000 bus provides increased power, stability, agility, data storage and transmission (over the BCP-2000 bus) as the demand for Earth remote-sensing information becomes more comprehensive. \n\nThe S/C is 3-axis stabilized. The ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem) employs star trackers, IRU (Inertial Reference Unit) and GPS for attitude sensing, and CMGs as actuators. A S/C body-pointing range of \u00b140\u00ba about nadir is provided corresponding to a FOR (Field of Regard) of 775 km in cross-track. An instantaneous pointing accuracy of \u2264 500 m is provided at any start and stop of an imaging sequence. On the ground, the geolocation accuracy of the imagery is 5.8 to 7.6 m without GPCs (Ground Control Points) and 2 m with GPCs (3\u03c3). The agile S/C provides retargeting at a rate of 4.5\u00ba/s with an acceleration of 2.5\u00ba/s2; it takes 9 s to slew the S/C over a ground distance of 300 km.\n\nS/C power of 3.2 kW (EOL) is provided by the solar panels; the battery capacity is 100 Ah. The solar arrays are being articulated into the sun (normal pointing into the sun). The rotational drive assemblies and drive control electronics, referred to as QuAD (Quiet Array Drive), are being provided by Starsys, a subsidiary of SpaceDev, Poway, CA. Unlike traditional stepper motor solar array drives, the QuAD technology provides low disturbance actuation, allowing spacecraft images to be captured at the same time that the solar arrays are being pointed.\n\nThe S/C bus has dimensions of 3.6 m (high) and 2.5 m in diameter, the span of the deployed panels measures 7.1 m. WorldView-1 has a launch mass of 2500 kg. The mission design life is 7.25 years. \n\nLaunch: A launch of the WorldView-1 spacecraft took place on Sept. 18, 2007 on a Delta-2920 vehicle from VAFB, CA.\n\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, altitude = 496 km (nominal), inclination = 97.2\u00ba. The equator crossing time is at 10:30 hours on a descending node. The period is 94.6 minutes. Note: While the low-altitude orbit selection offers better spatial resolutions than a higher one, it requires also more frequent reboosts to maintain the low orbit due to atmospheric drag influences.\n\nRF communications: The command data are in S-band at 2 or 64 kbit/s. The housekeeping telemetry and tracking is in X-band at 4, 16, or 32 kbit/s of real-time data, or 524 kbit/s of stored data. The imagery is downlinked in X-band at 800 Mbit/s. The S/C provides a data storage capacity of 2.2 Tbit in solid state memory with EDAC (Error Detection and Correction). A total of 331 Gbit of imagery per orbit may be collected.  In addition, direct (real-time) downlinks to customer sites are available using the same high-speed 800 Mbit/s X-band link. \n\nMission status: In early January 2008, DigitalGlobe announced the general availability of WorldView-1 imagery to its customers after all check-out aspects of the spacecraft and its payload had been completed. 6)\n\n\u2022 DigitalGlobe delivered its first sample set of high-resolution images on Oct. 15, 2007 and began supplying imagery to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) on Nov. 26, 2007 (the S/C reached already full operating capacity on Nov. 17. 2007). \n\nInformaiton obtained from http://www.eoportal.org/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: WORLDVIEW-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: WORLDVIEW-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n      Short_Name: MS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 496\n      Orbit_Inclination: 97.2\n      Period: 94.5\n      Repeat_Cycle: 1.7\n      Perigee: 499.7\n      Apogee: 500.8\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-10\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=12389\n   Online_Resource: http://www.digitalglobe.com/index.php/86/WorldView-1\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2007-09-18\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Design_Life: 7.25 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, USA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

                                "description": "GeoEye-1, formerly known as OrbView-5, is the next-generation high-resolution imaging mission of GeoEye, Dulles, VA, USA. In January 2006, the commercial imaging company GeoEye was formed, made up of former Orbimage of Dulles VA, and of former Space Imaging of Thornton, CO (Orbimage acquired Space Imaging in 2005 and gave the merged company the new name of GeoEye). The newly formed GeoEye company is the world's largest commercial satellite imagery provider.\n\nOn Sept. 30, 2004, OrbImage was awarded a NextView vendor contract of NGA (National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency). The contract, referred to as NextView OrbImage, provides long-term revenue commitments as well as capital for the development of OrbView-5. NGA's NextView program is designed to give US commercial imaging satellite operators the financing to build their satellites for high-resolution imaging.\n\nGeoEye's principal partners for the development and launch of the GeoEye-1 satellite include General Dynamics (formerly Spectrum Astro), ITT Industries (imager), and Boeing Launch Services. GeoEye's partners for the ground segment include IBM and MDA (MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates) of Richmond, BC, Canada.\n\nhe GeoEye-1 spacecraft is being designed and developed at General Dynamics/C4 Systems of Gilbert, AZ (formerly Spectrum Astro) as prime contractor. The contract was award in Dec. 2004. The spacecraft design is based on the SA-200HP standard modular bus (of Coriolis and SWIFT heritage). The spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized with a sophisticated attitude control system to provide a highly stable, while also highly agile imaging platform.\n\nA body-pointing capability of up to \u00b1 60\u00ba is being provided, made possible by enhanced reaction wheels (low jitter). The image geolocation accuracy is \u2264 3 m. The spacecraft mass is 1955 kg (bus mass = 1260 kg), the S/C design is fully redundant with an operational life of 7 years (the expected life is 10 years).\n\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, altitude = 684 km, inclination = 98\u00ba, period = 98 minutes, local equatorial crossing at 10:30 hours, effective revisit time capability \u2264 3 days.\n\nLaunch: A launch of GeoEye-1 is scheduled for August 2008 on a Delta-2 (7420-10) vehicle from VAFB, CA. The launch provider is ULA (United Launch Alliance). The launch delay from the fall of 2007 is due to a launch congestion at VAFB.\n\nRF communications: The source data are being stored on solid-state onboard recorders of 1.2 Tbit capacity. The downlink of imagery in X-band at 740 Mbit/s (or at 150 Mbit/s), the TT&C data are in S-band. The S/C is being operated from the command and control facility at GeoEye headquarters in Dulles, VA, along with an imagery acquisition station. Three other acquisition stations will be operated or leased by GeoEye in Barrow, AK, Troms\u00f8, Norway and Troll, Antarctica (the TrollSat station is located at 72\u00ba S and 2\u00ba E). The latter two stations are being leased from KSAT (Kongsberg Satellite Services) of Troms\u00f8, Norway.\nA total of four stations are needed to handle primary data reception due to the large volume of data that will be captured by the satellite. In addition, GeoEye will continue to support a network of receiving stations owned and operated by local business partners, referred to as Regional Affiliates and Regional Distributors.\n\nGround segment: GeoEye has built a fully integrated receiving, processing, and distribution network for delivering high-quality imagery products to customers around the world.\n\nIn late 2006, GeoEye purchased high-bandwidth, high-performance compute technology from SGI (Silicon Graphics Inc.). Four SGI Altix systems were installed at the Dulles (VA) ground station for data processing, distribution, and archiving services.\n\nSensor complement: (GIS)\n\nThe requirements of GeoEye-1 call for panchromatic imagery with a resolution of 0.41 m and multispectral imagery with a resolution of 1.64 m. The imager is being designed and developed by ITT Space Systems Division, formerly Kodak Remote Sensing Systems of Rochester, New York, which built also the sensor for Ikonos-2 (launch April 27, 1999). In January 2007, the GeoEye-1 imager system was delivered to General Dynamics for integration into the spacecraft.\n\nGIS (GeoEye Imager System). GIS is a pushbroom imaging system whose basic elements are the optics subsystem (telescope assembly), the focal plane assembly (CCD detector), and the digital electronics subsystem. The optics subsystem employs a TMA (Three Mirror Anastigmatic) telescope design with a primary mirror aperture of 1.1 m in diameter. Three mirrors are used to image and focus the light, and two additional mirrors to direct the image to the FPA (Focal Plane Assembly). The telescope is designed to give a near-perfect (diffraction limited) image to the FPA and to convert the analog pixels into digitized signals.\n\nThe FPA consists of an array of CCD detectors with 8 \u00b5m pixel size for PAN and 32 \u00b5m pixel size for multispectral imagery. ITT has included an outer barrel and door assembly to help protect the telescope and maintain its thermal environment.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GEOEYE-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: GEOEYE-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: ORBVIEW-5\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CCD IMAGER\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 684 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98 degrees \n      Equator_Crossing: 10:30 AM\n      Period: 98 minutes\n      Repeat_Cycle: 3 days\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-27\n   Online_Resource: http://launch.geoeye.com/LaunchSite/about/fact_sheet.aspx\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=13708\n   Sample_Image: http://launch.geoeye.com/LaunchSite/assets/images/about/satellite.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2008-08-22\n      Design_Life: 10 YEARS\n      Primary_Sponsor: US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

In this region, the tenuous gases are anything but quiet, as a mix of neutral and charged particles travel through in giant winds. These winds can change on a wide variety of time scales -- due to Earth's seasons, the day's heating and cooling, and incoming bursts of radiation from the sun.\n\nThis region of space and its changes have practical repercussions, given our ever-increasing reliance on technology -- this is the area through which radio communications and GPS signals travel. Variations there can result in distortions or even complete disruption of signals. In order to understand this complicated region of near-Earth space, called the ionosphere, NASA has developed the ICON mission. To understand what drives variability in the ionosphere requires a careful look at a complicated system that is driven by both terrestrial and space weather.\n\nICON will help determine the physics of our space environment and pave the way for mitigating its effects on our technology, communications systems and society.\n\nAdditional Information: https://www.nasa.gov/icon",

Some specific goals were (1) to\ndetermine the nature and magnitude of changes in mesospheric ozone\ndensities resulting from changes in the solar ultraviolet flux; (2) to\ndetermine the interrelationship between solar flux, ozone, and the\ntemperature of the upper stratosphere and mesosphere; (3) to determine\nthe interrelationship between ozone and water vapor; and (4) to\ndetermine the interrelationship between nitrogen dioxide and\nozone. The satellite experiment complement consisted of a solar\nultraviolet spectrometer, an ultraviolet ozone spectrometer, an\ninfrared radiometer, a 1.27-micrometer spectrometer, and a nitrogen\ndioxide spectrometer. In addition, a solar proton alarm detector was\ncarried on board to measure the integrated solar flux in the range 30\nto 500 MeV. Spin stabilized at 5 rpm, the satellite moved in a 3\na.m. to 3 p.m. sun-synchronous orbit. The spacecraft body was a\ncylinder approximately 1.7 by 1.25 m and consisted of two major\nmodules: the observatory module that housed the scientific\ninstruments, and the spacecraft bus. The spin axis was oriented normal\nto the orbital plane. The command system was capable of executing\ncommands in real time or from stored program control. Power was\nsupplied by a solar cell array.

In  conjunction  with\n  appropriate   laser-tracking   systems,   LAGEOS   permitted   extreme\n  precision-ranging     measurements    for    both    geometric    mode\n  (multilateration) and orbital dynamic mode determinations of positions\n  of  points  on  the  earth.   It  was  the  first spacecraft dedicated\n  exclusively  to  high-precision  laser  ranging and provided the first\n  opportunity  to  acquire  laser-ranging data that were not degraded by\n  errors  originating  in the target satellite.  The high-accuracy range\n  measurements from this permanent-orbiting reference point were used to\n  accomplish many extreme precision earth-dynamics measurements required\n  by  the earthquake hazard assessment and alleviation objectives of the\n  Earth and Ocean Physics Applications Program (EOPAP).  The performance\n  in   orbit   of   LAGEOS  was  limited  only  by  degradation  of  the\n  retroreflectors,  so many decades of useful life can be expected.  The\n  high mass-to-area ratio and the precise, stable (attitude-independent)\n  geometry  of  the  spacecraft,  together  with  the  orbit,  made this\n  satellite  the  most precise position reference available.  Because it\n  is  visible  in  all  parts of the world and has an extended operation\n  life in orbit, LAGEOS can serve as a fundamental standard for decades.\nAuxiliary Information\n  Launch Date and Time : 1976-05-04 08:00:00\n  Epoch Date and Time :  1976-05-05\n  Orbit Type :  Geocentric\n  Apogee(km) :    5946.\n  Perigee(km) :   5837.\n  Inclination :   109.8\n  Date of last update :  1992-03-09\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: LAGEOS-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: LAGEOS (Laser Geodetic Satellite)\n      Short_Name: LAGEOS-1\n      Long_Name: Laser Geodetic Satellite-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: LAGEOS-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: LASER TRACKING REFLECTOR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 109.90 deg\n      Period: 225.50 min\n      Perigee: 5,837 km\n      Apogee: 5,947 km\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-10-10\n   Online_Resource: http://msl.jpl.nasa.gov/QuickLooks/lageosQL.html\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/lageos-1-2\n   Online_Resource: http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/list_of_satellites/lag1_general.html\n   Sample_Image: http://msl.jpl.nasa.gov/QuickLooks/pictures/lageos.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1976-05-04\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Design_Life: 50 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

By measuring the time between transmission of\nthe beam and reception of the reflected signal from the\nsatellite, stations can precisely measure the distance between\nthemselves and the satellite. These distances can be used to\ncalculate station positions to within 1-3 cm. Long term data\nsets can be used to monitor the motion of the Earth's tectonic\nplates, measure the Earth's gravitational field, measure the\n\"wobble\" in the Earth's axis of rotation, and better determine\nthe length of an Earth day.\n\nLAGEOS 2 was a joint program between NASA and the Italian space\nagency (ASI), which built the satellite using LAGEOS 1 drawings\nand specifications, handling fixtures, and other materials\nprovided by NASA.\n\nLAGEOS 2's orbit was selected to provide more coverage of\n  seismically active areas, such as the Mediterranean Basin and\n  California, and may help scientists understand irregularities\n  noted in the motion of LAGEOS 1. Ground tracking stations are\n  located in many countries (including the US, Mexico, France,\n  Germany, Poland, Australia, Egypt, China, Peru, Italy, and\n  Japan) and data from these stations is available world-wide to\n  investigators studying crustal dynamics. LAGEOS 1 also\n  contains a message plaque addressed to human and other beings\n  of the far distant future with maps of the Earth from 3\n  different eras - 268 million years in the past, present day,\n  and 8 million years in the future (the satellite's estimated\n  decay date). Spacecraft: Both satellites are spherical bodies\n  with an aluminum shell wrapped around a brass core. The design\n  was a compromise between numerous factors including the need\n  to be as heavy as possible to minimise the effects of\n  non-gravitational forces vs.  being light enough to be placed\n  in a high orbit and the need to accommodate as many\n  retroreflectors as possible vs. the need to minimise surface\n  area to minimise the effects of solar pressure. The materials\n  were chosen to reduce the effects of the Earth's magnetic\n  field on the satellite's orbit.426 cube-corner retroreflectors\n  are imbedded in the satellites' surface.422 of these are made\n  of fused silica glass while the other 4 are made of\n  germanium. The vehicles have no onboard sensors or\n  electronics, and are not attitude controlled. Payload: Science\n  is performed by reflecting laser light from the vehicle's 426\n  retroreflectors.\n\n Additional characteristics:\n\n-50 years design life\n-0.6m total length\n-0.6m maximum diameter\n-405 kg total mass\n\n Additional information available at\n\"http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lageos.htm\"\n\n[Summary provided by SpaceBank.com]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: LAGEOS-2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: LAGEOS (Laser Geodetic Satellite)\n      Short_Name: LAGEOS-2\n      Long_Name: Laser Geodetic Satellite-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: LAGEOS-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: LASER TRACKING REFLECTOR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 52.70 deg\n      Period: 222.50 min\n      Perigee: 5,616 km\n      Apogee: 5,952 km\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-10-10\n   Online_Resource: http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lageos.htm\n   Online_Resource: http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/list_of_satellites/lag1_general.html\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/lageos-1-2\n   Sample_Image: http://msl.jpl.nasa.gov/QuickLooks/pictures/lageos.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1992-10-22\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Design_Life: 50 year\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

                                        "description": "EROS-A (of Ofeq-3 heritage) is a high-resolution commercial imaging satellite of ImageSat International N.V. headquartered at Limassol, Cyprus, and designed and built by Israeli Aircraft Industries Ltd. (IAI). The overall objective is to launch and operate a constellation of high-resolution commercial satellites, primarily for intelligence and national security applications and to serve a global customer base. The spaceborne remote sensing technology for the EROS family was approved by the government of Israel in Oct. 1996. \n\nThe EROS program offers a combination of services and products tailored to meet specific customer requirements and budgets: \n\n\u2022 The option to acquire exclusive imaging rights over a defined footprint or the ability to acquire imagery on an exclusive basis.\n\n\u2022 Rapid delivery of imagery to the customer, either through direct downlink, electronic transfer or courier.\n\n\u2022 Provision of low-cost imagery products to support applications in many fields.\n\nSpacecraft:\n\nThe EROS-A satellite structure consists of low-mass composite material with passive thermal control, it is three-axis stabilized. Attitude control and navigation is performed using horizon sensors, sun sensors, gyros and magnetometer, four reaction wheels and thrusters. The pointing accuracy is <0.1\u00ba in all three axes, attitude stabilization is < 40 \u00b5rad/s, the jitter is < 0.2 \u00b5rad. S/C mass = 260 kg (178 kg S/C bus, 42 kg of instrument mass and 30 kg of hydrazine), solar panel power (silicon array, fixed panels) = 450 W (EOL), plus 14 Ah NiCd batteries for eclipse operation, the bus power consumption at imaging session is 300 W. S/C design life = 4 years, however the estimated operational life of the satellite is ten years. \n\nRF communications: Imagery is transmitted in X-band at a rate of 70 Mbit/s (RF downlink) to the ground receiving stations, using a 1.5 W transmitter and one of the two existing two-axis gimbaled directional antennas. The EROS satellites are monitored/operated in S-Band (TT&C) via a single ground control station (GCS), located at IAI/MBT in Israel (3 to 4 passes per day and per satellite are in station visibility). The S-band data rate is either 2.5 or 15 kbit/s selectable by the GCS.\n\nImageSat has a global network of ground segment infrastructure, for real-time image data acquisition. This network is comprised of the ImageSat Central Ground Control Station, a network of EROS-compatible Ground Receiving Stations on 5 continents and EROS-compatible Ground Control Stations based at exclusive customers' premises (see SOP Program).\n\nThe EROS A satellite has limited availability of onboard source data storage, as the satellite was designed to cater to customers acquiring real-time, exclusive imaging and download rights over a defined geographic footprint, in view of their own EROS-compatible GRS (Ground Receiving Stations).\n\nOperational capabilities/services primarily include:\n\n\u2022 Satellite Operating Partner (SOP) Program. This service provides a dedicated regional satellite with local customer tasking. SOP receiving ground stations are able to plan, to generate and to transmit imaging commands to the satellite and to download imagery in real-time.\n\n\u2022 PAS (Priority Acquisition Service) Program. The service provides highest priority tasking of the EROS satellite, in areas not previously acquired by SOP Customers.\n\n\u2022 Non-exclusive acquisitions. ImageSat sells EROS imagery on a non-exclusive basis to customers for civilian applications, such as mapping, disaster planning and monitoring, environmental management, homeland security and border control, and a range of development-related projects. \n\naunch: EROS-A was launched on a Russian Start-1 launcher on Dec. 5, 2000 from the Svobodny Cosmodrome in eastern Siberia.\n\nOrbit for EROS-A: Circular sun-synchronous orbit, altitude 480 km, inclination = 97.3\u00ba, period = 94.7 minutes, local time of descending node at 10:00 hours. The revisit capability at at latitude of 10\u00ba within a 15\u00ba cone is within 10.5 days. A revisit period/satellite at latitude of 10\u00ba is 4.5 days within a 30\u00ba cone, and only 2.5 days within a 45\u00ba cone.\n\nOperational status of mission: The EROS-A spacecraft and all subsystems are operating nominally as of 2008. Operations are expected to last until 2010. \n\nBackground on EROS program:\n\nEROS is a program of ImageSat International, N.V., formerly WIS (West Indian Space) Ltd., Cayman Islands. The name change took place in June 2000. ImageSat was re-incorporated in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles. ImageSat's ownership includes: Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) of Tel-Aviv (owned by the Israeli government), Elbit Systems Ltd. of Haifa, and private investors from Europe and the United States.\n\n\u2022 EROS-B was launched on April 25, 2006 on a Start-1 launch vehicle from the Svobodny Cosmodrome in eastern Siberia\n\n\u2022 A third satellite, EROS C, will offer comparable panchromatic resolution to EROS B, as well as multispectral resolution of 2.8 m GSD; it is planned for launch in 2009. \n\nInformation obtained from http://www.eoportal.org/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: EROS-A1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: EROS-A1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Earth Remote Observation System-A\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 480\n      Orbit_Inclination: 97.3\n      Period: 94.7\n      Perigee: 498.6\n      Apogee: 511.2\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-09\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=10063\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2000-12-05\n      Launch_Site: Svobodny Cosmodrome, Russia\n      Design_Life: 4 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: ImageSat International, Israel\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The overall objective is to provide high-resolution imagery to the customer base.\n\nSpacecraft:\n\nThe EROS-B series S/C structure is identical to that of EROS-A, based on the Ofeq platform of Israel's Defense Ministry, and designed and built by Israel Aircraft Industries Ltd. (IAI/MBT). The deployed S/C structure is 2.3 m high and 4.0 m wide. The S/C is is 3-axis stabilized and the light/rigid design of the EROS satellite family allows for a great degree of platform agility. The spacecraft is very agile, a body-pointing capability of \u00b145\u00ba from nadir is provided in all directions, supporting the daily data acquisition plan. The S/C attitude is sensed and controlled as done with EROS-A. In addition, there is a star sensor for the B satellite series. The nominal S/C design life is six years.\n\nThe nominal S/C launch mass is ~290 kg; however, additional onboard fuel (up to 60 kg) is sufficient for S/C operations of up to 10 years. This increased the spacecraft launch mass to about 350 kg. \n\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, mean altitude = 500 km, inclination = 97.4\u00ba, local time of descending node (LTDN) at 14:00 hours. - Note: The orbits of EROS-A and EROS-B are phased in the same orbital plane thereby increasing the revisit time of the constellation.\n\nLaunch: A launch of EROS-B took place on April 25, 2006 on a Start-1 launch vehicle from the Svobodny Cosmodrome in eastern Siberia (location at: 51.4\u00ba N, 128.3\u00ba E). 3)\n\nRF communications: Imagery is transmitted in X-band at a rate of 280 Mbit/s (downlink) to the ground receiving stations, using a 1.5 W transmitter and one of the two existing two-axis gimbaled directional antennas. The EROS satellites are monitored/operated in S-Band (TT&C) via a single ground control station (GCS), located at IAI/MBT in Israel (3 to 4 passes per day and per satellite are in station visibility). The S-band data rate is either 2.5 or 15 kbit/s selectable by the GCS.\n\nImageSat has a global network of ground segment infrastructure, for real-time image data acquisition. This network is comprised of the ImageSat Central Ground Control Station, a network of EROS-compatible Ground Receiving Stations on 5 continents and EROS-compatible Ground Control Stations based at exclusive customers' premises. \n\nSensor complement: (PIC-2)\n\nPIC-2 (Panchromatic Imaging Camera-2), designed and developed by ElOp (Electro Optical Industries) of Rehovot, Israel, a subsidiary of Elbit Systems Ltd. The EROS-B series imager instrument features CCD pushbroom technology in combination with a TDI (Time Delay Integration) scheme in its focal plane, a cumulative expose concept of each ground image line by a CCD detector array, to improve the SNR value (an important issue for high-resolution imaging). The instrument uses also a Cassegrain telescope with an aperture of 50 cm in diameter and a focal length of 5 m (folded optics). FOV = 1.5\u00ba. The PIC-2 instrument is rigidly mounted to the S/C structure looking into the nadir direction, thus permitting a body-pointing observation scheme. \n\nhe CCD pushbroom detector array provides 10,000 pixels per line and a total of 96 lines for selectable TDI observation support. Pushbroom scanning is provided for panchromatic imagery only in the spectral range of 0.5 - 0.9 \u03bcm. The ground sampling distance (GSD) is 0.70 m, the swath width is 7 km at nadir. The data is quantized at 10 bit/sample.\n\nThe imager instrument of EROS-B spacecraft can be operated in either asynchronous or in synchronous imaging mode. In synchronous mode, the S/C platform keeps a constant pointing angle toward the Earth's surface. In asynchronous mode, imaging by the detector array is performed in a \"step-and-stare\" fashion, i.e., by slewing the S/C platform in the along-track direction (this permits in particular the generation of mosaics as well as the support of stereo imaging of targets of interest).\n\nInformation obtained from http://www.eoportal.org/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: EROS-B1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: EROS-B1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 500\n      Orbit_Inclination: 97.4\n      Period: 94.7\n      Perigee: 503.5\n      Apogee: 514.7\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-09\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=12460\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2006-04-25\n      Launch_Site: Svobodny Cosmodrome, Russia\n      Design_Life: 10 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: ImageSat International, Israel\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The mission objectives were to observe the aurora\nborealis, study aurora-related phenomena, and study the ionosphere and\nmagnetosphere. The main body of the spacecraft was a cylinder 0.946 m in\ndiameter with shallow truncated cones attached at both ends. Most of the\nsurface was covered with solar cells that produced 35 W. Two booms of roughly\n1.9 m each extended outward from the equator of the main body. At the tip of\neach boom was a permanent magnet to provide alignment of the spacecraft center\naxis along the local geomagnetic field line. Two sets of circularly polarized\nquadrupole antennas, one for UHF (400 MHz) and another for VHF, extended from\nopposite ends of the spacecraft. The VHF antenna was diplexed for telemetry\n(136 MHz) and command (148 MHz). Other attitude sensors included a vector\nmagnetometer and a solar sensor. The spacecraft contained a tape recorder to\nstore 160 min of data at 512 bps or 40 min at 2048 bps, with readout in 10 min\nat 8192 bps. Besides the solar cells, there was a nickel-cadmium battery for\nnighttime operation.\n                  - Auxiliary Information -\n    Launch Date and Time :  1978-02-04 07:00:00\n    Epoch Date and Time  :  1978-02-06\n    Apogee (km or AU):      3978.\n    Perigee (km or AU):     642.\n    Inclination (degree) :  65.4\n    Orbit Type :            Geocentric\n    Information last updated on 1991-11-15\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: EXOS-A\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: EXOS-A\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: EXOS-A\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 65.4 deg\n      Perigee: 642 km\n      Apogee: 3978 km\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-11-19\n   Online_Resource: http://www.oma.be/sevem/EXOS-A.html\n   Sample_Image: http://edu.jaxa.jp/materialDB/display/large-67262.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1978-02-04\n      Launch_Site: Uchinoura Space Center, Japan\n      Primary_Sponsor: JAXA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Through UK-DMC, BNSC became the anchor tenant for the SSTL-led Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC), accelerating the formation of a full international consortium.\n\nUK-DMC is a satellite of the standard Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) design, with added research and development payloads. Like all of the standard DMC satellites, it carries an optical imaging payload developed by SSTL to provide 32-m ground resolution with an exceptionally wide swath width of over 640 km. The payload uses green, red and near infrared bands equivalent to Landsat TM+ bands 2, 3 and 4. In comparison to the other DMC satellites, UK-DMC features increased on-board data storage, with 1.5 gigabyte capacity. Images are returned to the SSTL mission operations centre using the Internet Protocol over an 8-Mbps S-band downlink.\n\nUK-DMC also contains a commercial Internet router from Cisco Systems, which builds on the use of the Internet Protocol by the DMC satellites to experiment with Internet packet routing to and in space.\n\nUK-DMC has also provided an opportunity for SSTL to test a new concept in remote sensing, GPS reflectometry. This technique, which measures the signals from the GPS navigation system after they are reflected off the sea, could revolutionize oceanographic remote sensing. If UK-DMC validates theories of GPS reflectometry, the technique could one day enable satellites to measure the height of waves on the high seas, providing important data to ship owners and operators. SSTL is using imagery from the UK-DMC to investigate the full range of uses for large-coverage images with medium spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. The UK-DMC satellite will also operate as part of a constellation providing images to disaster relief agencies worldwide in times of need.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: UK-DMC\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: UK-DMC\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: BNSCSAT\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: GPS\n      Short_Name: SLIM-6\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 686 Km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.0 degrees\n      Period: 98.4 min\n      Perigee: 675\n      Apogee: 692\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-04\n   Online_Resource: https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/3rd-party-missions/current-missions/uk-dmc\n   Online_Resource: https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/u/uk-dmc-2\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2003-09-27\n      Launch_Site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia\n      Primary_Sponsor: British National Space Centre (BNSC)\n      Primary_Sponsor: Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.

                                        "description": "AlSAT-1 is part of an international (BNSC-UK, China, Nigeria and Thailand) disaster-monitoring constellation (DMC) of 6 micro-satellites dedicated for monitoring disasters throughout the earth, such as floods, fires, earthquakes, volcanoes, large-scale industrial accidents and civil strife. When there are no disasters, AlSAT-1 will be used for Algerian purposes such as monitoring desertification, industrial and marine pollution, agricultural monitoring, geophysics mapping and fire detection. The nature of the mission is that the 6 micro-satellites, when coordinated together, can produce a daily revisit with a 32 m resolution multi-spectral imaging and 600 km ground track. AlSAT-1 uses the flight proven modular SSTL bus from previous missions but will carry a push broom imager for the first time on SSTL micro-satellites. As a part of the constellation and to maintain a daily coverage, AlSAT-1 is equipped with a propulsion system for orbit corrections.\n\nAlSAT-1's main payload a multi-spectral earth observation imager. Digital store and forward communications can be experienced between two points and autonomous GPS positioning techniques also accomplished.\n\nThe Algerian satellite is one of SSTL\u0092s new generation microsatellites in a sense that it carries a new type of push broom sensors. These types of sensors can previously only be found in larger commercial satellites. Because of the advance in electronics and semiconductor integration on a single chip, nowadays these sensors are being implemented by SSTL on microsatellites.\n\nAlSAT-1 is designed to view the earth surface with a 32 m resolution in three spectral bands (R, G, NIR) and a ground track of 600 km. The spectral bands were chosen to correspond to those used by commercial satellites in the following wavelengths (in micrometer) 0.5-0.6 micrometer, 0.6-0.7 , 0.7-0.8 ). The imaging system comprises two cameras for each spectral band and two sensors with 10 000 pixels each. This represents a huge quantity of data for the electronics on board (processors, SSDR, fast clocks) to deal with.\n\nThe cameras provide 32 m ground resolution in 3 spectral bands capable of giving detailed information on earth resources, land use and effects of pollution and natural disasters using 2x10 000 pixels linear array detectors digitized to 8 bits radiometric resolution (256 levels). The image swath width is 600 km and the imager can collect images continuously along the flight track. The images are stored on board the microsatellite via the On Board Computer (OBC) and Controller Area Network (CAN) in the 2x512 Mbytes Solid State Data Recorder (SSDR) for later transmission to ground via digital packet error controlled links at 8 Mbit/s in S-band.\n\nHowever, on the satellite there will be an option to do \u0093windowing\u0094. By using this technique, we can take images of 100x100 km and thus extend the track range.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: ALSAT-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: ALSAT-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SLIM-6\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 700\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98\n      Period: 98.4\n      Perigee: 676\n      Apogee: 691\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-02\n   Online_Resource: https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/a/alsat-2\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2002-11-28\n      Launch_Site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia\n      Primary_Sponsor: Algeria\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Telemetry stations\nwere located  so that primary data coverage was near the 80 degrees\nWest meridan plus areas near Hawaii, Singapore, Australia, England,\nIndia, Norway and Central Africa.  Initially data were recorded about\n8 hours per day.  Degradation of the power supply system had, by June\n1975, reduced the operating time to about 1/2 hour per day.

After about 500 days in orbit,\nthe ALOUETTE-1 spin rate slowed more than had been expected, to about\n0.6 rpm when satellite spin-stabilization failed.  It is now believed\nthat the satellite gradually progressed towards a gravity gradient\nstabilization with the longer antenna pointing earthward.  Attitude\ninformation was deduced from a single onboard magnetometer only, and\naided by temperature measurements on the upper and lower heat shields.\n\nDATA ACQUISITION:  Alouette-1 was an early space era satellite, and\nthere was no onboard tape recorder so data were available to the\nground stations only from the immediate vicinity of the telemetry\nstations.  The ground telemetry stations were located to provide\nprimary data coverage near the 80 degrees West meridian and in\nareas near Hawaii, Singapore, Australia, Europe and Central Africa.\nInitially, data were recorded for about 6 hours per day.  In September\n1972, spacecraft operations were terminated.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: ALOUETTE-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: ALOUETTE\n      Short_Name: ALOUETTE-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: ALOUETTE-A\n      Short_Name: 00424\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: TELEMETER\n      Short_Name: MAGNETOMETERS\n      Short_Name: PARTICLE DETECTORS\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-08-22\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1962-049A\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1962-09-29 \n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

With the launch of Aura NASA has begun to make the most comprehensive measurements of the Earth's atmosphere. It also caps off\na 15-year international effort to establish the world's most comprehensive Earth Observing System, whose overarching goal is to determine the extent, causes, and regional consequences of global change. Aura's objective is to study the chemistry and dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere with emphasis on the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (0-30km) by employing multiple instruments on a single satellite.  The satellite's measurements enable scientists to investigate questions about ozone trends, air quality changes and\ntheir linkages to climate change.

Zeya is named after the\nZeya River, which is very close to it's launch site, Cosmodrome\nSvobodniy. This was the first satellite launched from this new\nRussian launch site in far eastern Russia.  Note: Sometimes also\nspelled Zeia.\n\nILRS Mission Support Status: Satellite laser ranging was used\nfor precision orbit determination for this spacecraft and used\nfor calibration of GPS and GLONASS navigation equipment aboard\nthe satellite. This satellite was only tracked for 6 months by\nthe international laser ranging network. SLR tracking support\nwas discontinued on 29 July 1997.\n\nInstrumentation:  Zeya has the following instrumentation onboard:\n\n1) Radio equipment\n2) GPS receiver\n3) GLONASS receiver\n4) Laser retroreflector array\n\nRetroReflector Array (RRA) Characteristics: The retro-reflector\narray is a box array of 20 corner cubes, which are optimized at\n532 nanometers. Twenty retroreflectors operating with principle\n\"not more than one reflectors works in any direction\" are\ninstalled on the satellite. Each retroreflector has field of\nview of 35 arc degrees. Retroreflectors ensure reflection of\nlaser light within 47% of 4 steradian. Satellite's design\nprovides accuracy of link of range measurements to the center of\nmass with root mean square error of about 5 mm. Systematic\ncorrection is 419 mm. The satellite is spinning around Y axis\nwith angular velocity about 30 revolutions per minute.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/list_of_satellites/zeya/\"\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]",

The objective of this program,\nalso called the TIROS Operational System (TOS), was to acquire global\nobservational data routinely on a daily basis.  This system consisted of\na pair of ESSA satellites in sun-synchronous (polar) orbit.  The odd\nnumbered satellites (ESSA-1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) utilized the Advanced\nVidicon Camera System (AVCS) to obtain global imagery which were\ntransmitted to the ESSA Command and Data Acquition (CDA) stations at\nWallops, Virginia, and Fairbanks, Alaska.  The CDA stations relayed the\ndata to the National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS), which later\nbecame the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information\nService (NESDIS), located in Suitland, Maryland, for processing and\ndistribution to forecasting centers of the U.S. and other nations.  The\neven numbered satellites (ESSA-2, 4, 6, and 8) were equipped with\nAutomatic Picture Transmission (APT) TV cameras which transmitted\ntelevision pictures directly to ground stations worldwide.\n-----------------\nEntry taken from:\nRao, P.K., S.J.

Developers have also enhanced the satellite's focused, target-point observation capabilities, enabling the device to gather accurate readings from a broader range of target points - an ability that will be especially beneficial in evaluations of industrial areas, densely populated areas, and other areas with large quantities of greenhouse gas emissions. In another improvement over its predecessor, the GOSAT-2 is also capable of monitoring carbon monoxide concentrations.",

At present, the elevation models that are available for large parts of Earth are of low resolution, inconsistent or incomplete. In addition, they are commonly based on different data sources and survey methods. TanDEM-X, TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement, is designed to close these gaps and deliver a homogenous elevation model that should prove indispensable for many scientific and commercial applications. Orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 500 kilometres, the two nearly-identical radar satellites have begun mapping its surface.\n\nThe first of the two, TerraSAR-X, has been operating since 2007. Three years years on, it has been joined by its twin satellite, TanDEM-X. Flying in close formation only a few hundred metres apart, the two satellites are imaging the terrain below them simultaneously, from different angles. These images are processed into accurate elevation maps with a 12-metre resolution and a vertical accuracy better than 2 metres. The amount of data generated by the satellites will grow to 1.5 petabytes within three years, corresponding to a storage capacity of almost 200,000 DVDs. Like the TerraSAR-X mission, TanDEM-X is a project developed under a public-private partnership between the German Aerospace Center, DLR, and Astrium GmbH based in Friedrichshafen, Germany.\n\nThe TanDEM-X mission\n\nThe TanDEM-X mission will survey all 150 million square kilometres of Earth's land surface several times over during its three-year mission. Apart from its high measuring-point density (a 12-metre grid) and high vertical accuracy (better than two metres), the elevation model generated by TanDEM-X will have another unrivalled advantage \u2013 being entirely homogenous, it will serve as a basis for maps that are globally consistent. Conventional maps are often fragmented along national borders, or difficult to reconcile as they are based on different survey methods or because of time lags between survey campaigns.\n\nTogether TanDEM-X and TerraSAR-X are form the first configurable synthetic aperture radar interferometer in space. Besides this primary goal, the mission has several secondary objectives based on new and innovative methods such as along-track interferometry, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar interferometry, digital beamforming and bistatic radar. The TanDEM-X satellite follows the TerraSAR-X design with minor modifications such as an additional cold gas propulsion system (powered by high-pressure nitrogen gas) to enable fine-tuning of its relative position during formation flying and an additional S-band receiver to receive status and position information sent by TerraSAR-X. The TanDEM-X satellite has been designed for a nominal lifetime of five years and has a planned overlap with TerraSAR-X of three years. TerraSAR-X holds consumables and resources for up to seven years of operation however, potentially allowing for a prolongation of the overlap and the duration of the TanDEM-X mission",

MacDonald Dettwiler will own and operate the satellite and the\nCSA's investment will be recovered through the supply of imagery to a number of\ngovernment agencies during the mission lifetime.\n\nThe design of RADARSAT-2 has been driven by the needs of the emerging Earth\nObservation market, to provide users around the world with high-quality data\nproducts. RADARSAT-2 will be capable of imaging at spatial resolutions ranging\nfrom 3 to 100 meters with swath widths ranging from 20 to 500 kilometres.\nRADARSAT-2 is also the first commercial radar satellite to offer\nmulti-polarization capability that aids in identifying a wide variety of\nsurface features and targets. The satellite is scheduled for launch in 2005 and\nhas a design life of 7 years.\n\nRADARSAT-2 is a truly world-class mission and the next step in MacDonald\nDettwiler's goal to being a world-leading company in the delivery of a broad\nrange of information products and services to manage the scope of human\nactivities on our planet.\n\nOrbit Characteristics:\n\nAltitude (average): 798 km\nInclination: 98.6\u00b0\nPeriod: 100.7 minutes\nAscending Node: 18:00 hrs\nSun-synchronous: 14 orbits per day\nRepeat Cycle: 24 days\n\nAdditional information available at:\nhttp://www.radarsat2.info/\n\n[Summary provided by MacDonald Dettwiler.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: RADARSAT-2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: RADARSAT\n      Short_Name: RADARSAT-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: RADARSAT-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 798 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.6 deg\n      Period: 100.7\n      Repeat_Cycle: 24 days\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-11-13\n   Online_Resource: http://www.radarsat2.info/\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2007-12-08\n      Primary_Sponsor: Canada/CSA\n      Primary_Sponsor: Canada/MDA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The apogee was high enough to permit measurements above the interaction regions of suprathermal ions, and also plasma flow measurements at the feet of the magnetospheric field lines. The general form of the spacecraft was a short polygon 137 cm in diameter and 115 cm high. The triaxial antennas were 23 m tip-to-tip. One 6-m boom was provided for remote measurements. The spacecraft weight was 403 kg. Power was supplied by a solar cell array, which charged two 6-ampere-hour nickel-cadmium batteries. The spacecraft was three-axis stabilized with the yaw axis aligned toward the center of the earth to within 1 deg. The spin axis was normal to the orbit plane within 1 deg with a spin rate of one revolution per orbit. A single-axis scan platform was included in order to mount the low-altitude plasma instrument (81-070B-08). The platform rotated about the spin axis. A pulse code modulation telemetry data system was used that operated in real time or in a tape-recorder mode. Data were acquired on a science-problem-oriented basis, with closely coordinated operations of the various instruments, both satellites, and supportive experiments. Measurements were temporarily stored on tape recorders before transmission at an 8:1 playback-to-record ratio. Since commands were also stored in a command memory unit, spacecraft operations were not real time. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: DE-2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: DE (Dynamics Explorer)\n      Short_Name: DE-2\n      Long_Name: Dynamics Explorer-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: DE 2\n      Short_Name: DE-B\n      Short_Name: Dynamics Explorer-B\n      Short_Name: Explorer 63\n      Short_Name: 12625\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: RPA\n      Short_Name: VECTOR MAGNETOGRAPHS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Period: 98 min.\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-09-12\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1981-070Bdata.html\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1981-08-03\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Two satellites, DE 1 and DE 2, were launched together and were placed in polar coplanar orbits, permitting simultaneous measurements at high and low altitudes in the same field-line region. The DE 1 spacecraft (high-altitude mission) uses an elliptical orbit selected to allow (1) measurements extending from the hot magnetospheric plasma through the plasmasphere to the cool ionosphere; (2) global auroral imaging, wave measurements in the heart of the magnetosphere, and crossing of auroral field lines at several earth radii; and (3) measurements for significant periods along a magnetic field flux tube. The spacecraft approximated a short polygon 137 cm in diameter and 115 cm high. The antennas in the X-Y plane measured 200-m tip-to-tip, and on the Z-axis are 9 meters tip-to-tip. Two six-meter booms are provided for remote measurements. Power is supplied by a solar cell array, mounted on the side and end panels. The spacecraft is spin stabilized, with the spin axis normal to the orbital plane, and the spin rate at ten plus or minus 0.1 rpm. A pulse code modulation (PCM) telemetry data system is used that operates in real time or in a tape-recorder mode. Data have been acquired on a science-problem-oriented basis, with closely coordinated operations of the various instruments, both satellites, and supportive experiments. Data acquired from the instruments are temporarily stored on tape recorders before transmission at an 8:1 playback-to-record ratio. Additional operational flexibility allows a playback-to-record ratio of 4:1. The primary data rate is 16,384 bits per second. Since commands are stored in a command memory unit, spacecraft operations are not real time, except for the transmission of the wideband analog data from the Plasma Wave Instrument (81-070A-02). On October 22, 1990 science operations were terminated. On February 28, 1991 Dynamics Explorer 1 operations were offically terminated. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: DE-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: DE (Dynamics Explorer)\n      Short_Name: DE-1\n      Long_Name: Dynamics Explorer-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: DE 1\n      Short_Name: DE-A\n      Short_Name: Dynamics Explorer-A\n      Short_Name: Explorer 62\n      Short_Name: 12624\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MAGNETOMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-09-12\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1981-070A\n   Sample_Image: http://www-pi.physics.uiowa.edu/sai/gallery/destack.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1981-08-03 \n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

                                        "description": "COSMO-SkyMed (Constellation of Small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation) is a 4-spacecraft constellation, conceived by ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana), and funded by the Italian Ministry of Research (MUR) and the Italian Ministry of Defense (MOD), Rome, Italy. The program is managed in cooperation by ASI and MOD. Each of the four satellites is equipped with a SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) instrument and is capable of operating in all visibility conditions at high resolution and in real time.\n\nThe overall objective of this program is global Earth observation and the relevant data exploitation for the needs of the military community as well as for the civil (institutional, commercial) community.\n\nSample applications of COSMO-SkyMed data are seen the following fields:\n\n\u2022 Defense and security applications: Surveillance, intelligence, mapping, damage assessment, vulnerability assessment, target detection/localization\n\n\u2022 Risk management applications: Floods, droughts, landslides, volcanic/seismic, forest fire, industrial hazards, water pollution\n\n\u2022 Other applications: Marine and coastal environments, agriculture, forestry, cartography, environment, geology and exploration, telecommunication, utilities and planning\n\n\u2022 Provision of commercial imaging services\n\n\u2022 The high revisit frequency offered by the four X-band SAR spacecraft is also expected to provide a unique potential to the operational meteorological user community through provision of ancillary data and/or data on meteo-correlated phenomena, in particular as regards sea ice monitoring and study of ocean wave patterns.\n\nBackground: In 1996 the Italian Government provided initial funding for the realization of a national Earth observation program. In 1997 the general guidelines for the 1998-2002 Italian National Space Plan (PSN) were approved including the activities on Earth observation. The strategic element in this plan is the COSMO-SkyMed dual-use program of ASI. 1) 2)\n\nIn the summer of 2001, the Italian Ministry of Defense became a partner in the COSMO-SkyMed program (a welcome funding partner for the Italian Ministry of Research). However, the dual-use nature of the COSMO-SkyMed program, i. e. civil (research and commercial) and military use of its data products, resulted in a virtually classified program. A great disadvantage of the new arrangement is that rather sparse technical information of the mission can only be made available to the public.\n\nAlthough the first constellation satellite SAR instruments (SAR-2000) will observe in X-band (9.6 GHz with a wavelength of 3.1 cm), multi-mode scenarios (X-, C- L- and P-band) are planned for the future.\n\nThe overall system architecture is composed of a space segment, a constellation of SAR satellites, and a ground segment including full featured user services. The requirements call for the following general performance characteristics: 3)\n\n\u2022 Full global observation coverage with all weather, day/night acquisition capability\n\n\u2022 Collection capability of large areas within a single pass, with along-track stereo imaging during a single pass\n\n\u2022 High image quality, to allow a robust image interpretability at the requested scale of analysis (data sets are characterized by adequate spatial and spectral resolution suitable to perform analyses at different scales of detail)\n\n\u2022 Ground track repeatability: the satellites of the SAR constellation shall have a ground track repeatability of better than 1 km\n\n\u2022 Fast response times (from the data/service user request up to the data/service delivery to that requiring user).\n\nThe SABRINA project was started in 2004/5. \n\nThe COSMO-SkyMed space segment is composed of a constellation of four SAR satellites. The PRIMA \\[Piattaforma Riconfigurabile Italiana Multi-Applicativa (Reconfigurable Italian Platform for Multiple Applications)\\] bus of Alcatel Alenia Space is being employed. Alcatel Alenia Space is also the prime contractor of the space segment \\[funding by ASI and I-AD (Ministry of Defense)\\]. - Note: As of April 10, 2007, the EC approved the transfer to Thales of Alcatel-Lucent's shareholdings in the two space sector joint venture companies Alcatel Alenia Space and Telespazio. Hence, Alcatel Alenia Space was renamed to Thales Alenia Space.\n\nThe S/C is three-axis stabilized, it consists of the main body (bus), two deployable solar arrays, and a SAR antenna. The bus provides all support functions like: AOCS, electrical power (power generation, storage and distribution), data handling, thermal control, RF communications, and on-orbit propulsion for orbit injection and maintenance. The platform mechanical configuration consists of two elements or modules, namely:\n\n\u2022 SVM (Service Module) at the bottom of the bus which contains all bus subsystems including the propulsion module\n\n\u2022 PLM (Payload Module) at the top, dedicated to the payload complement, the PDHT (Payload Data Handing and Transmission) subsystem, and the AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem) with star trackers gyros actuators.\n\nThe bus structure material is CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic) while SVM and PLM consist of aluminum alloys. The interfaces of the SAR antenna, star trackers and gyros are mounted on the CFRP structure for pointing precision and stability (a star tracker is being used as well as a high-quality GPS receiver). The SSTI (Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking Instrument) is the LAGRANGE GPS receiver of Laben SpA. The SAR antenna bore sight is pointing with an incidence angle about 38\u00ba to the right side of the S/C ground track. AOCS provides an antenna steering capability of \u00b12\u00ba in yaw as well as for a re-pointing capability to the left side of the ground track. Each S/C in the constellation features a RCT (Reaction Control Thruster) system for orbit maintenance.\n\nThe mass of each spacecraft is about 1700 kg. The design life is 5 years. The S/C provides an onboard operational autonomy for a period of 24 hours. \n\nLaunch: The launch of the first COSMO spacecraft in the constellation took place on June 8, 2007 (UTC). The launch was provided by the Boeing Company on a Delta-2 (7420-10 configuration) vehicle from VAFB, CA. This represented the first commercial Delta-2 launch since the formation of the United Launch Alliance (ULA) in December 2006.\n\nCircular sun-synchronous dawn-dusk orbit, nominal altitude = 619.6 km, inclination = 97.86\u00ba, period = 97.1 min, with LTAN (Local Time of Ascending Node) at 6:00 AM, 14.8125 rev./day (or 14 13/16). All spacecraft of the SAR constellation will be positioned in the same orbital plane with a phasing outlined in Table 2. The nominal repeat cycle is 16 days; however, each single satellite will have a near revisit time of 5 days. \n\nSatellite\tLaunch date\tNominal EOL (End Of Life)\tExtended lifetime\nCSK-1\t8-Jun-07\t\tJun-14\t\t\t\t7-Jun-16\nCSK-2\t9-Dec-07\t\tDec-14\t\t\t\t8-Dec-16\nCSK-3\t25-Oct-08\t\tOct-15\t\t\t\t25-Oct-16\nCSK-4\t6-Nov-10\t\tNov-17\t\t\t\t6-Nov-17\n\nCOSMO-SKYMED Platform_Details\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Associated_Instruments Short_Name: SAR\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n      Primary_Sponsor: Italian Ministry of Defense (MOD)\n      Primary_Sponsor: Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI), Italy",

Since satellites were a new technology, the TIROS Program also tested various design issues for spacecraft: instruments, data and operational parameters. The goal was to improve satellite applications for Earth-bound decisions, such as \"should we evacuate the coast because of the hurricane?\".\n\nThe TIROS Program's first priority was the development of a meteorological satellite information system. Weather forecasting was deemed the most promising application of space-based observations.\n\nTIROS proved extremely successful, providing the first accurate weather forecasts based on data gathered from space. TIROS began continuous coverage of the Earth's weather in 1962, and was used by meteorologists worldwide. The program's success with many instrument types and orbital configurations lead to the development of more sophisticated meteorological observation satellites.",

The craft was made of aluminum alloy and stainless steel then covered by 9260 solar cells. The solar cells served to charge the nickel-cadmium batteries. Three major changes were made from the previous TIROS models. Two wide-angle television cameras were housed in the craft in place of one high-resolution and one low-resolution camera.\n\nA new infrared experiment and improved remote control programmers were also new additions. This craft contained an electronic clock to control the operations of the infrared horizon sensor as well as the magnetic orientation system. A magnetic tape recorder was still provided for each camera to store photographs while the satellite was out of range of the ground station network. One scanning and two non-scanning radiometers were also on board.\n\nThe antennas were of the same configuration as both previous TIROS models. Although one of the cameras failed 12 days into the mission, photograph quality from the other camera was excellent and many tropical storms during the 1961 hurricane season were photographed. TIROS-3 was also credited with the discovery of Hurricane Esther.",

Operational satellites were renamed NOAA.\n\nThe primary objective of ITOS was to provide improved\noperational infrared and visual observations of earth cloud\ncover for use in weather analysis and forecasting. Secondary\nobjectives included providing both solar proton and global heat\nbalance data on a regular daily basis. To accomplish these\ntasks, the spacecraft carried:\n\n-two television cameras for Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) and\n-two Advanced Vidicon Camera System (AVCS) cameras. It also carried\n-a low-resolution Flat Plate Radiometer (FPR),\n-a Solar Proton Monitor (SPM), and\n-two scanning radiometers that not only measured emitted infrared\nradiation, but also served as a backup system for the APT and AVCS\ncameras.\n\nThe nearly cubical spacecraft measured 1 by 1 by 1.2 m. The TV\ncameras and infrared sensors were mounted on the satellite\nbaseplate with their optical axes directed verticially\nearthward. The satellite was equipped with three curved solar\npanels that were folded during launch and deployed after orbit\nwas achieved. Each panel measured over 4.2 m in length when\nunfolded and was covered with 3420 solar cells, each measuring 2\nby 2 cm. The ITOS dynamics and attitude control system\nmaintained desired spacecraft orientation through gyroscopic\nprinciples incorporated into the satellite design. Earth\norientation of the satellite body was maintained by taking\nadvantage of the precession induced from a momentum flywheel so\nthat the satellite body precession rate of one revolution per\norbit provided the desired 'earth looking' attitude. Minor\nadjustments in attitude and orientation were made by means of\nmagnetic coils and by varying the speed of the momentum\nflywheel.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://www.skyrocket.de/space/doc_sdat/noaa_itos-a.htm\"\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: TIROS-M\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: TIROS\n      Short_Name: TIROS-M\n      Long_Name: Television Infrared Observation Satellite-M\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: ITOS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: HRIR\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-11-14\n   Online_Resource: http://www.skyrocket.de/space/doc_sdat/noaa_itos-a.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/700s/spac0170.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1970-01-23\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The\nsatellite design provided an economical and stable sun-synchronous\nplatform for advanced operational instruments to measure the earth's\natmosphere, its surface and cloud cover, and the near-space\nenvironment.  The satellite was based upon the Block 5D spacecraft bus\ndeveloped for the U.S. Air Force, and it was capable of maintaining an\nearth-pointing accuracy of better than plus or minus 0.1 degree with a\nmotion rate of less than 0.035 degree/second.\nPrimary sensors included an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer\n(AVHRR) and a TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). Secondary\nexperiments consisted of a Space Environment Monitor (SEM) and a Data\nCollection System (DCS).\n__________\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage (SIRS).

The most energetic tropical systems, such as the cloud clusters of the ITCZ, the monsoon systems and the tropical cyclones, extend over hundreds of kilometers. Hence, a ground resolution of about 10 km is adequate for these observations. Megha-Tropiques, with its unique combination of scientific payloads and its special near-equatorial orbit (offering improved data sampling of the ITCZ), is expected to provide valuable data for climate research.",

                                        "description": "Introduction\n\nThis mission was studied in France in the context of GEWEX (Global Energy and Water cycle Experiment). For understanding tropical meteorological and climatic processes, it appeared necessary to obtain reliable statistics on the water and energy budget of the tropical atmosphere and to describe the evolution of its systems (monsoons, cyclones, \u2026) at appropriate time scales. In parallel, tropical atmospheric and oceanic missions were also studied in India, which is directly concerned by these phenomena. The first originality of MEGHA-TROPIQUES is to associate three radiometric instruments allowing to observe simultaneously three interrelated components of the atmospheric engine : water vapour, condensed water (clouds and precipitations), and radiative fluxes. The second is to privilege the sampling of the intertropical zone, accounting for the large time-space variability of the tropical phenomena. Moreover, the MEGHA-TROPIQUES microwave radiometer MADRAS could be one element complementing the constellation of mini-satellites of the Global Precipitation Mission .\nScientific objectives\n\n- to improve the knowledge of the water cycle in the intertropical region, to evaluate its consequences on the energy budget,\n\n- to study the life cycle of tropical convective systems over ocean and continents, the environmental conditions for their appearance and evolution, their water budget, and the associated transports of water vapor.\nApplied objectives\n\n- to provide data about the processes leading to dramatic weather events affecting the Tropical countries, as hurricanes, systems producing heavy rainfalls, processes governing monsoons variability or droughts.\nMission Scenario\n\nThe key of this mission is the repetitivity of the measurement in the Tropics. The orbit of the platform must be in a low inclination on the equatorial plane. The altitude of the orbit has to be high enough to allow a wide swath of the instruments.\nGeophysical parameters to be retrieved:\n\nAtmospheric water cycle elements: Water vapor (integrated and vertical distribution), cloud condensed water content, ice/water, precipitation.\n\nRadiative budget elements: solar reflected and terrestrial emitted fluxes at the top of the atmosphere.\nInstrumental payload\n\nThe instruments have to be complementary to what exists on geostationary satellites (VIS-IR imagers). Microwave instruments are then fundamental. The main payload instruments are:\n\n- A microwave imager (MADRAS) aimed mainly to study precipitation and cloud properties, including ice at the top of clouds (SSM/I type, with an additional channel at 157 GHz).\n\n- A microwave sounding instrument for the atmospheric water vapor (SAPHIR - 6 channels in the 183 GHz band).\n\n- A radiometer devoted to the measurement of outgoing radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere (ScaRaB).\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: MEGHA-TROPIQUES\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: MEGHA-TROPIQUES\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SAPHIR\n      Short_Name: MADRAS\n      Short_Name: SCARAB\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 867\n      Orbit_Inclination: 20\n      Period: 102.16 minutes\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > LOW EARTH ORBIT > INCLINED NON-POLAR\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2012-01-20\n   Online_Resource: http://meghatropiques.ipsl.polytechnique.fr/mission-description.html\n   Sample_Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/72/Megha_tropiques.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2011-10-12\n      Launch_Site: SRIHARIKOTA ISLAND, INDIA\n      Design_Life: 4\n      Primary_Sponsor: Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)\n      Primary_Sponsor: Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales (CNES)\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Terra is the first EOS (Earth Observing System) platform and provides global data on the state of the atmosphere, land, and oceans, as well as their interactions with solar radiation and with one another.\n\nSince the 1950's, it has become increasingly clear that human activities are modifying the composition of the atmosphere on a global scale. As the result of industrialization, the concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by about 20% during this period. More recently, the stratospheric concentrations of chemically-active gases containing chlorine, bromine, and fluorine have dramatically increased. These trends have created issues of global interest including global warming and declining levels of ozone (both globally and in the ozone &hole& in the Antarctic). It has become increasingly clear, however, that these processes do not occur independently of one another and can only be understood in the context of a global system. Accurate and precise measurements are needed to unravel complex and interactive relationships between chemical, radiative, and dynamical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, and on land. As a result, in 1991 NASA initiated a comprehensive program to understand the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, land, and cryosphere (ice and snow) as a single, complex, interactive system. NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) consists of a series of spaceborne instruments to monitor crucial components of the Earth system, an advanced data handling system, and teams of scientists who will evaluate on-going climate change and predict future changes. Ultimately, EOS will produce scientifically sound recommendations for environmental policy to national and international bodies to mitigate or prepare for these changes.\n\nKey Terra Facts:\nJoint with Japan and Canada\nOrbit:\nType: Near-polar, sun-synchronous\nEquatorial Crossing: 10:30 a.m.\nAltitude: 705 km\nInclination: 98.1 degrees\nPeriod: 98.88 minutes\nRepeat Cycle: 16 days\nDimensions: 2.7 m x 3.3 m x 6.8 m\nMass: 5,190 kg\nPower: 2,530 W\nDesign Life: 6 years\n\nTerra Status:\nOperating instruments: ASTER, CERES, MODIS, MISR, and MOPITT are operating well.

This is accompanied by state of the art facilities for image archiving and processing. The THEOS satellite is based on EADS Astrium's new generation of high performance AstroSat optical Earth observation satellites and benefits from the company's extensive experience in this field which started with the SPOT and MetOp satellites.\n\nAs part of the THEOS contract, Thai engineers will join the Astrium development team and attend intensive space programme training. The company firmly believes that this cooperation contract paves the way for further development of GISTDA and space activities in Thailand.\n\nThe THEOS payload features both high resolution in panchromatic mode (2m) and wide field of view in multi-spectral mode and has been tailored to Thailand's specific needs with a worldwide imaging capability. It will be launched in 2008 on a sun synchronous orbit at an altitude of around 820km.\n\nTHEOS will be fully owned and operated by GISTDA and will provide Thailand with worldwide geo-referenced image products and image processing capabilities for applications in cartography, land use, agricultural monitoring, forestry management, coastal zone monitoring and flood risk management. THEOS will provide access to any part of Thailand in less than two days.\n\n[Source: EADS Astrium Home Page, http://www.astrium.eads.net/families/daily-life-benefits/remote-sensing/theos ]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: THEOS\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: THEOS\n      Long_Name: Thai Earth Observation System\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MS\n      Short_Name: PAN\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 822 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.7\n      Equator_Crossing: 10:00 AM\n      Period: 101.4\n      Repeat_Cycle: 26\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-03\n   Online_Resource: http://www.astrium.eads.net/families/daily-life-benefits/remote-sensing/theos\n   Online_Resource: http://www.space-risks.com/SpaceData/index.php?id_page=8&Satellite_Name=THEOS\n   Sample_Image: http://earth.esa.int/earthnetmedia/img/0e/tm_theos.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2008-10-01\n      Launch_Site: Yasny Launch Base, Russia\n      Primary_Sponsor: Thailand\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

                                "description": "The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (or TRMM) is a NASA satellite that provides more information both to test and to improve those models. TRMM is particularly devoted to determining rainfall in the tropics and subtropics of the Earth. These regions make up about two thirds of the total rainfall on Earth and are responsible for driving our weather and climate system. TRMM contributed to a better understanding of where and how much the winds blow, where the clouds form and rain occurs, where floods and droughts will occur, and how the winds drive the ocean currents. TRMM accomplished this not just by providing rainfall data but, more importantly, by providing information on heat released into the atmosphere as part of the process that leads to rain.\n\nTRMM was launched on November 27, 1997, on the Japanese H-II vehicle from the Tanegashima Space Center in Tanegashima, Japan. Continuous science data collection began December 8, 1997. Upon completion of the nominal 3-year prime mission, the decision was made to boost the mission from its original altitude of 350km to 402.5km, to reduce fuel consumption and extend the mission life. The TRMM boost was completed August 24, 2001, and the orbit was maintained until 2014, when fuel was depleted and the spacecraft began to descend. Mission operations were terminated in April 2015, the spacecraft re-entered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and mostly burned up in June 2015.\n\nTRMM exceeded its 3-year design goal by collecting 17 years of rainfall data, creating a benchmark rainfall climatology which is used to test, compare and improve global climate models. The TRMM dataset of rain distribution across the tropics has narrowed considerably the range of uncertainty in previous space-based rainfall estimates. The choice of a precessing, low-inclination orbit (35\u00b0) enabled the quantification of the diurnal cycle of precipitation and convective intensity over land and ocean tropics-wide on fine scales (0.25\u00b0). TRMM products have provided the first comprehensive estimates of how rainfall is directly related to latent heat release in the atmosphere, a key characteristic in understanding the impact of tropical rainfall on the general circulation of the atmosphere. Based on hydrometeor vertical structure information from the TRMM active and passive sensors, TRMM produced climatologies of latent heating profiles for analysis and comparison with global models. In addition, the lightning sensor delivered a detailed global map of lightning distribution, and combined with the rain data, led to quantifying the lightning/convection relation for land and ocean.\n\n\nLaunch:  Launched: November 27, 1997\nLaunch Site: Tanegashima Space Center, Japan\n\nOrbit:  Altitude: 402 km\nInclination: 35 degrees\nPeriod: 92.6 minutes\nNon-Sun-Synchronous\n\nVital Statistics: Weight: 3512 kg\nPower: 1100 watts\nDesign Life: 3 years\n\nInstruments: \nCERES (Clouds and the Earth Radiant Energy System\nLIS (Lightning Imaging Sensor)\nTMI (TRMM Microwave Radiometer)\nPR (RADAR)\nVIRS (Visible/Infrared Radiometer)\n\nWebsite: \nhttps://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/trmm\n\n[Summary provided by NASA.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: TRMM\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: TRMM\n      Long_Name: Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: TRMM\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CERES-PFM\n      Short_Name: PR\n      Short_Name: TMI\n      Short_Name: VIRS\n      Short_Name: LIS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 402 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 35 degrees\n      Period: 92.6 minutes\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Inclined Non-Polar\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-11-28\n   Online_Resource: https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/trmm\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1997-11-27\n      Launch_Site: Tanegashima Island, Japan\n      Design_Life: 3 YEARS\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: JAPAN/JAXA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Objectives\nincluded obtaining an accurate description of the earth's magnetic field,\nobtaining data for use in the update and refinement of world and regional\nmagnetic charts, compilation of a global crustal magnetic anomaly map, and\ninterpretation of that map in terms of geologic/geophysical models of the\nearth's crust. The spacecraft was launched into a low, near-polar, orbit by the\nScout vehicle. The basic spacecraft was made up of two distinct parts: the\ninstrument module that contained a vector and a scalar magnetometer and their\nunique supporting gear; and the base module that contained the necessary\ndata-handling, power, communications, command, and attitude-control subsystems\nto support the instrument module. The base module complete with its subsystems\nwas comprised of residual Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS-C) hardware. The\nmagnetometers were deployed after launch to a position 6 m behind the\nspacecraft. At this distance, the influence of magnetic materials from the\ninstrument and base module (chiefly from the star cameras) was less than 1 nT.\n                  - Auxiliary Information -\n    Launch Date and Time :  1979-10-30 14:16:00\n    Epoch Date and Time  :  1979-10-31\n    Apogee (km or AU):      578.4\n    Perigee (km or AU):     351.9\n    Inclination (degree) :  96.8\n    Orbit Type :            Geocentric\n    Information last updated on 1992-04-13\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: MAGSAT\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: MAGSAT\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: AEM-3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 96.8 deg\n      Perigee: 351.9 km\n      Apogee: 578.4 km\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-11-20\n   Online_Resource: http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Magsat.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.daviddarling.info/images/Magsat.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1979-10-30\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The spacecraft and its instruments were designed and built at LASP, the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. SNOE was launched on February 26, 1998, and was operated from the mission operations center at the LASP Space Technology Research building. SNOE re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on Dec. 13, 2003, completing a very successful mission. This site contains a description of the SNOE mission, spacecraft drawings and images, and provides access to the scientific data and publications.

Thanks to new technical developments, the FORUM (Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring) candidate would measure radiation emitted from Earth across the entire far-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Significantly, it measures in the 15\u2013100 \u00b5m range, which has never been done from space before. 1)\n\nThese observations are important because Earth emits infrared radiation to space, which is affected by water vapor and cirrus clouds, which, in turn, play key roles in Earth\u2019s temperature.\n\nFORUM\u2019s benchmark measurements would improve our understanding of the greenhouse effect and, importantly, contribute to the accuracy of climate change assessments that form the basis for policy decisions.",

IMAGE is the first satellite mission\ndedicated to imaging the Earth's magnetosphere, the region of\nspace controlled by the Earth's magnetic field and containing\nextremely tenuous plasmas of both solar and terrestrial\norigin. Invisible to standard astronomical observing techniques,\nthese populations of ions and electrons have traditionally been\nstudied by means of localized measurements with charged particle\ndetectors, magnetometers, and electric field\ninstruments. Instead of such in-situ measurements, IMAGE employs\na variety of imaging techniques to \"see the invisible\" and to\nproduce the first comprehensive global images of the plasma\npopulations in the inner magnetosphere. With these images, space\nscientists are able to observe, in a way never before possible,\nthe large-scale dynamics of the magnetosphere and the\ninteractions among its constituent plasma populations.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://pluto.space.swri.edu/IMAGE/\"\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: IMAGE\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: IMAGE\n      Long_Name: Imager for Magnetopause -to - Aurora Global Exploration\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: IMAGE\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: UVI\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-11-20\n   Online_Resource: http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Sample_Image: http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/image_launch_a5.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2000-03-25\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The polar orbit\nprovided sampling of all latitudes, the perigee moved through all\nlatitudes in 3 months, and all local times in 4 months.\nUnfortunately, a failure in the solar power panels resulted in the\ntermination of AE-D operations on January 29, 1976, after slightly\nless than 4 months of useful spacecraft life.  However, all the\nregions at the perigee altitudes were sampled during this time.  The\nAE-D spacecraft re-entered the earth's atmosphere about 1 month after\nthe cessation of telemetry.  To continue the correlated observations\nwith the AE-E mission, the earlier AE-C spacecraft was then\nreactivated on February 28, 1976 as replacecment for AE-D.

The satellite, a passive system\nwith no onboard sensors or electronics, is covered with retroreflectors that\nreflect laser beams sent from ground stations. By measuring the round trip time\nof the transmitted light, the distance between the satellite and the station\ncan be determined with approximately 1 centimeter. These measurements are used\nto determine variations in the rotational characteristics of the Earth and for\nmeasurement of the Earth's gravitational field. As the vehicle's orbit decays,\nthe satellite's orbital motion will also be used calculate to atmospheric\ndensities. Deployed from the Mir space station, GFZ-1 was the first non-Russian\nsatellite launched from MIR. GFZ-1 was developed in under 12 months and cost\napproximately &#36700,000 (including design, fabrication, test, and launch).\nData collection, distribution and evaluation is coor dinated by the project's\nscientists at the GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam.\n\nSpacecraft The satellite consists of a spherical body made from brass with 60\ncorner cube reflectors distributed regularly over the satellite's surface.\nThese retroreflectors are quartz prisms placed in special holders that are\nrecessed in the satellite's body. External metallic surfaces are covered with\nwhite paint for thermal control purposes and to facilitate visual observation\nin space. The vehicle's size was limited by the maximum allowable dimensions of\nthe Mir airlock (30 cm). The vehicle carries no electronics or sensors and is\nnot attitude controlled.\n\n[Source: NASA Mission and Spacecraft Library]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GFZ-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: GFZ-1\n      Long_Name: GeoForschungsZentrum-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: GFZ-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SLR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 400 km\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-11-19\n   Online_Resource: http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/pb1/op/gfz1/index_GFZ1.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/pb1/op/gfz1/GFZ1_1.small.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1995-04-09\n      Launch_Site: 1999-06-23\n      Design_Life: 3.5-5 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

These were the first and\nsecond prototypes for the GOES satellite series.  At this altitude it\ncircled the axis of the Earth once in 24 hours, making its speed\nsynonymous with the Earth's rotation, so that the satellite remained\nessentially stationary over a given geographical point. The two SMS\nsatellites were employed to provide overlapping coverage that centers\non the U.S. and extends over the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the\nwestern Pacific Ocean.  The scanning system consisted of a mirror that\nis stepped mechanically to provide North to South viewing, while the\nrotation of the satellite provided West to East scanning.  The mirror\nis stepped following each West to East scan, with each step resulting\nin a change in scan angle of 192 microradians, or 7 km near nadir.  A\nsequence of 1821 scans is performed to provide a 'full disk' view from\nthe Northern to the Southern Earth horizon.  At the rotation rate of\n100 rpm, 18.21 minutes are required to complete one full North to\nSouth view of the Earth.  The VISSR field of view provides a ground\nresolution of 0.9km in the visible, and 3.0km in the infrared.\nEntry taken from:\nCornillon, P., A Guide to Environmental Satellite Data, University of Rhode\nIsland Marine Technical Report 79, 1982.\nData Catalog Series for Space Science and Applications Flight Missions,\nNational Space Science Data Center/World Data Center A for Rockets and\nSatellites, Volume 2A, September 1982.\nData Catalog Series for Space Science and Applications Flight Missions,\nNational Space Science Data Center/World Data Center A for Rockets and\nSatellites, Volume 4A, July 1985.\nRao, P.K., S.J.

The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell.  The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube.  The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft.  A support structure extended radially from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment.  Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command.  The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem.  A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit. This spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer, meteorological data collection and relay system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer.  Throughout its 7 year history, it operated at 45, 75 and 92 degrees West.\n__________\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage (SIRS).

                                        "description": "KOMPSAT-2 (also referred to as Arirang-2 by South Korea) was developed by KARI (Korea Aerospace Research Institute) to continue the observation program of the KOMPSAT-1 mission. The main mission objectives of the KOMPSAT-2 are to provide a surveillance capability for large-scale disasters by acquiring high-resolution imagery for GIS (Geographic Information Systems) applications.\n\nThe spacecraft design is based on the KOMPSAT-1 heritage making extensive use of existing hardware, software, tools, and facilities; it allows parallel integration of the payload, equipment, and propulsion modules. The KOMPSAT-2 bus structure consists of the five modules: SMS (Structure and Mechanisms Subsystem), TCS (Thermal ConTrol Subsystem), AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem), TC&R (Telemetry Command and Ranging) subsystem, EPS (Electrical Power Subsystem), PS (Propulsion Subsystem), and the FSW (Flight Software) element.\n\nThe AOCS provides three-axis stabilization (3-axis control with zero momentum bias system) with high accuracy for roll, pitch and yaw pointing. Star trackers, gyro reference assemblies, three-axis magnetometers, magnetic torquers and reaction wheels are used for attitude sensing and control. The pointing accuracy is < 0.025\u00ba in roll and pitch, and 0.08\u00ba in yaw. The pointing knowledge is 0.020\u00ba in roll and pitch, and 0.045\u00ba in yaw. The spacecraft platform offers a cross-track body-pointing capability through roll maneuvers (up to \u00b145\u00ba). The propulsion subsystem makes use of re-used components (hydrazine monopropellant thrusters with blowdown pressure-feed system, 73 kg propellant).\n\nThe spacecraft mass is 800 kg (including propellant), the S/C size is hexagonal: 1.85 m diameter x 2.6 m in height (6.8 m length in deployed configuration), the power is 955 W (EOL) provided by two solar arrays (GaAs cell technology). A super NiCd battery has a capacity of 30 Ah for eclipse phase support. The S/C design life is three years. EADS Astrium has been selected by KARI to support the platform development and manufacture of KOMPSAT-2.\n\nLaunch: A launch of the KOMPSAT-2 spacecraft took place on July 28, 2006 with a Rockot-KM launch vehicle of Eurockot Launch Services from Plesetsk, Russia.\n\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, altitude = 685 km, inclination = 98.13\u00ba, period = 98.46 min, the mean local time of the ascending node is at 10:50 hours. The KOMPSAT-2 orbit is identical to that of KOMPSAT-1 but with a different phase (180\u00ba apart).\n\nRF communications: Onboard storage capacity of 96 Gbit (BOL) and 64 Gbit (EOL) for image data. S-band (TT&C) and X-band (payload data at 8.205 GHz downlink frequency) communications are provided for all data transmission to the ground (real-time and playback), the downlink data rate is 320 Mbit/s (QPSK modulation). Encryption of image data. The CCSDS communication protocols are implemented. The S-band data rates are: 2 kbit/s uplink and 1.5 Mbit/s downlink.\n\nMission status: The KOMPSAT-2 spacecraft and its payload are operating nominally as of 2008.\n\n\u2022 KOMPSAT-2 completed its commissioning phase in late September 2006 and started its nominal operations phase in October 2006.\n\n\u2022 In August, 2006, KOMPSAT-2 had provided its first images.\n\n\u2022 On Oct. 24, 2005, KARI has made Spot Image (France) exclusive distributor of imagery from the KOMPSAT-2 Earth observation satellite - except for customers from Korea, the United States, and the Middle East, which are being serviced by KAI Image Inc. of Korea.\n\nInformation obtained from http://www.eoportal.org/\n\nKOMPSAT-2 Specifications\nImaging mode: \t        Panchromatic \tMultispectral\nSpatial Resolution: \t1m \t4m\nSwatch Width: \t        15km \t15km\nDuty Cycle: \t        >20% per Orbit\nOff-Nadir Imaging: \tUp to 45 degree\nOrbital Altitude: \t685km, Sun-synchromous orbit\nOperation Life: \tMinimum 5 years ( Design Life :3years)\nRevisit Time: \t        Less than 3 days\nData Transmission: \t320 Mbps\nData Storage: \t        90 Gbits\nDynamic Range: \t        10 bits per pixel \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: KOMPSAT-2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: KOMPSAT-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Arirang-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERA\n      Short_Name: MS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 685\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.13\n      Period: 98.46\n      Repeat_Cycle: ~14\n      Perigee: 682.0\n      Apogee: 708.0\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > LOW EARTH ORBIT > POLAR SUN-SYNCHRONOUS\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-09\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=7483\n   Online_Resource: http://www.kaiimage.co.kr/eng/kompsat_b01.asp\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2006-07-28\n      Launch_Site: PLESETSK COSMODROME, RUSSIA\n      Design_Life: Minimum 5 years ( Design Life :3years)\n      Primary_Sponsor: Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), South Korea\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The TET-1 satellite has been circling Earth in a polar orbit since July 2012 and has successfully concluded the first part of its mission as a technology testing platform. The BIROS satellite has the same bus as TET-1, but is additionally equipped with a propulsion system for active attitude and orbit control. BIROS was launched on 22 June 2016 at 05:55 CEST.

Project funding is provided by the German Ministry for Economics and Technology (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Technologie). The overall objective is to provide industry and research institutes with adequate means for the in-flight validation of space technology. Certain programmatic rules were established for the space segment and the ground segment to realize TET-1 as a low-cost mission within a relatively short timeframe under the leadership of an industrial space company as prime contractor.\n\nFlight opportunities for technology demonstration and verification should ideally be provided on a regular basis in a cost efficient and safe manner. A market survey of German industries' and institutes' technologies has shown that about 75% of the experiments can be verified using a microsatellite.\n\nThe OOV-Program is thus structured into two main parts with respect to the flight opportunities offered. The first comprises the microsatellites TET with a planned flight opportunity every two years. For payloads which do not fit on TET microsatellite concept, DLR will cooperate with national and international partners to provide flight opportunities on other carriers.",

The BIROS satellite is part of DLR's FireBird constellation, which consists of two spacecraft, TET-1 and BIROS. The primary goal of this mission is the detection and monitoring of so called HTEs (High Temperature Events), e.g. forest fires or other hot spots.\n\nThe secondary BIROS mission goals are:\n\n\u2022 The processing capabilities of the BIROS payload will be considerably upgraded.\n\n\u2022 BIROS will be equipped with OSIRIS (Optical Space Infrared Downlink System), a new onboard optical communication terminal, developed at DLR, to demonstrate the following capabilities:\n\n- three different laser systems for downlink communications at data rates up to 1 Gbit/s\n\n- four quadrant laser detector onboard for improved pointing accuracy\n\n- a beacon laser in uplink to support the BIROS attitude control; it may also be used for an optical uplink.\n\n\u2022 VAMOS (Verification of Autonomous Mission Planning On-board a Spacecraft). VAMOS is a DLR/GSOC software experiment with the objective to schedule and (re-)command tasks.\n\n\u2022 AVANTI (Autonomous Vision Approach Navigation and Target Identification), an optical navigation experiment. The goal is to demonstrate autonomous rendezvous to (and departure from) a non-cooperative client using vision-based navigation. 3)\n\n\u2022 BIROS will carry onboard the picosatellite BEESAT-4 (Berlin Experimental and Educational Satellite-4) of TU Berlin(1U CubeSat, 1 kg) and release it through a spring mechanism [ejection by SPL (Single Picosatellite Launcher ) after the successful check-out and commissioning of all relevant BIROS subsystems]. After separation, it will perform experimental proximity maneuvers in formation with the picosatellite solely based on optical navigation. 4)\n\nSpacecraft:\n\nFor BIROS, the TET-X platform is being used, a slightly improved version of the existing TET-1 satellite bus. The TET-X bus shares the TET-1 bus envelope of 670 x 580 x 880 mm3 and 70 kg satellite bus mass with 460 x 460 x 428 mm3 payload volume and 50 kg payload mass. The three-axis attitude control system provides a pointing knowledge of 10 arcsec and a position accuracy of 10 m. But the TET-X bus contains a new power subsystem, new transmitters and OBC (OnBoard Computer), with same envelopes and masses as for TET-1.\n\nThe BIROS spacecraft will be built again in a cooperation of DLR and AFW (Astro Feinwerktechnik GmbH), Berlin Adlershof. Both satellites (TET-1 and BIROS) are equipped with an identical main payload. These are the infrared cameras for Earth observation, especially hot spot detection. As part of the DLR FireBIRD mission, both satellites shall be used in a constellation for fire detection and monitoring.\n\nA special point in the design of the satellite bus was the interface between satellite bus and payload. To support different kinds of missions, the system contains the nominal satellite bus and a PSS (Payload Supply System). This payload supply system is on its payload interface side adaptable to the data (SpaceWire, RS422/485, CAN-Bus, etc.) and power interface requirements, data storage requirements and payload control requirements.\n\nThe nominal satellite bus will remain unchanged for different missions, but of course can be adapted in parts, like an upgrade to X-band system if higher data rates are required. The PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) of the PSS will be adapted for every new payload accommodation.",

Direct measurements of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state are needed to improve our understanding of regional water cycles, ecosystem productivity, and processes that link the water, energy, and carbon cycles. Soil moisture information at high resolution enables improvements in weather forecasts, flood and drought forecasts, and predictions of agricultural productivity and climate change.\n\nThe National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Integrated Program Office (IPO) has developed a tri-agency set of requirements for the next generation of polar-orbiting operational environmental satellites. A novel approach combining radar-radiometer and L-band mapping of global soil moisture will allow SMAP to far exceed the NPOESS soil moisture threshold (minimum performance) requirements for sensing depth and spatial resolution. With \"fast-track\" development, it is possible that SMAP could provide critical gap-filling soil moisture measurements for NPOESS, which were lost when the Conical Microwave Imager/Sounder was cancelled from the first NPOESS platform.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: SMAP\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: NASA Decadal Survey\n      Short_Name: SMAP\n      Long_Name: Soil Moisture Active and Passive Observatory\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SMAP L-BAND RADIOMETER\n      Short_Name: SMAP L-BAND RADAR\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2009-09-17\n   Online_Resource: https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2015-01-31\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The\nspacecraft was a 9.8 kg magnesium sphere 50.8 cm in diameter. It\ncontained two optical telescopes with two photocells. The sphere was\ninternally gold-plated and externally covered with an aluminum deposit\ncoated with silicon oxide of sufficient thickness to provide thermal\ncontrol for the instrumentation. Radio communication was provided by a\n1-W, 108.03-MHz telemetry transmitter and a 10-mW, 108-MHz beacon\ntransmitter that sent a continuous signal for tracking purposes. A\ncommand receiver was used to activate a tape recorder that relayed\ntelescope experiment data to the telemetry transmitter. Both\ntransmitters functioned normally for 19 days. The satellite was spin\nstabilized at 50 rpm, but telemetry data were poor because of an\nunsatisfactory orientation of the spin axis. The power supply for the\ninstrumentation was provided by mercury batteries.\n                  - Auxiliary Information -\n    Launch Date and Time :  1959-02-17 16:05:00\n    Epoch Date and Time  :  1959-02-17 16:48:00\n    Apogee (km or AU):      3320.\n    Perigee (km or AU):     559.\n    Inclination (degree) :  32.88\n    Orbit Type :            Geocentric\n    Information last updated on 1992-04-14\nVanguard 3 was launched by a Vanguard rocket from the Eastern Test\nRange into a geocentric orbit. The objectives of the flight were to\nmeasure the earth's magnetic field, the solar X-ray radiation and its\neffects on the earth's atmosphere, and the near-earth micrometeoroid\nenvironment. Instrumentation included a proton magnetometer, X-ray\nionization chambers, and various micrometeoroid detectors. The\nspacecraft was a 50.8-cm-diameter magnesium sphere. The magnetometer\nwas housed in a glass fiber phenolic resin conical tube attached to\nthe sphere. Data transmission stopped on December 11, 1959, after 84\ndays of operation. The data obtained provided a comprehensive survey\nof the earth's magnetic field over the area covered, defined the lower\nedge of the Van Allen radiation belt, and provided a count of\nmicrometeoroid impacts.

The ENVISAT satellite is part\nof the International Earth Observation System (IEOS). The ENVISAT is\ndesigned to study Earth's resources and to contribute to the study of\nland surface properties, atmospheric chemistry, aerosol distribution,\nocean and ice processes, and marine biology. The ENVISAT spacecraft\nis based on the Polar Platform (PPF) concept and consists of a Service\nModule (SM) which provides main support functions, and a\nmission-specific Payload Module (PLM) which provides the instruments\nand payload support functions. The Payload Module consists of the\nPayload Equipment Bay (PEB) and the Payload Carrier (PLC). The Payload\nData Management Subsystem performs instrument and support subsystems,\ndata processing, telecommand and telemetry management, data-bus\ncontrol, failure management, and instrument operations timeline\nmanagement. Commonad and control is provided by the Payload Module\nComputer (PMC). Scientific data generated from the instruments will be\nprocessed by the High Speed Multiplexer (HSM) for recording or\ntransmission to the ground.  A set of four tape recorders provide a\nrecording speed of 2 to 4 Mbps and a capacity of 25 Gbits. The\ncommunication subsystem uses an x-band link directly to the ground and\na Ka-band bi-directional link via ESA's Data Relay Satellite\n(DRS). The Thermal Control Subsystem consists of a Heater Switching\nUnit (HSU), heaters, thermistors and thermostats. The Service Module\n(SM) consists of a carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) cone with a\nlauncher interface at one end and a propulsion module at the\nother. The power subsystem consists of up to eight nickel-cadmium\nbatteries (40 Ahr) and a modular solar array. The SM on-board data\nmanagement is done by the Central Computer Unit (CCU). Command and\ncontral are done via S-band communications direct to the ground or\nthrough the DRS. The Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem (AOCS)\nprovides three-axis stabilization.  Altitude measurements will be\nprovided by digital Sun sensors, Earth-horizon sensors and gyroscopes\nwhile altitude control will be provided by monopropellent\nthrusters. Fine pointing is accomplished through star sensors and\ngyroscopes, reaction wheels, and magneto-torquers.\n\nThe ENVISAT consists of : (1) Advanced SAR (ASAR), (2) Global Ozone\nMonitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS), (3) Medium Resolution Imaging\nSpectrometer (MERIS), (4) Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric\nSounding (MIPAS), (5) Radar Altimeter-2 (RA-2), (6) Advanced Along Track\nScanning Radiometer (AATSR), (7) Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer\nfor Atmospheric Cartography (SCIMACHY), (8) Microwave Radiometer (MWR),\n(9) Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite\n(DORIS), and (10) a Laser Retroreflector (LRR) for tracking.\n\nJust weeks after celebrating its tenth year in orbit, communication with the Envisat satellite was suddenly lost on 8 April. Following rigorous attempts to re-establish contact and the investigation of failure scenarios, the end of the mission is being declared.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: ENVISAT\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: ENVISAT\n      Long_Name: Environmental Satellite\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: RA-2\n      Short_Name: MWR\n      Short_Name: MIPAS\n      Short_Name: MERIS\n      Short_Name: LRR\n      Short_Name: GOMOS\n      Short_Name: DORIS\n      Short_Name: ASAR\n      Short_Name: AATSR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 800-km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.55 degrees\n      Equator_Crossing: 10 am Local time: e.g.\n      Repeat_Cycle: 35 days\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > LOW EARTH ORBIT > POLAR SUN-SYNCHRONOUS\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-09-20\n   Online_Resource: http://envisat.esa.int/\n   Sample_Image: http://www.dutchspace.nl/uploadedImages/Business_Fields/Earth_observation/Envisat/Envisat-in-Orbit-512.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2002-03-01\n      Launch_Site: KOUROU, FRENCH GUIANA\n      Design_Life: 10 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: European Space Agency\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The GOSAT mission goals call for the study of the transport mechanisms of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).\n\nThe emphasis is on atmospheric monitoring to clarify the sources and sinks of CO2 on a sub-continental scale. The overall mission objective is to contribute to environmental administration by estimating the Green House Gases (GHGs) source and sink on a sub-continental scale and to support the Kyoto protocol that was adsorbed at COP3/UNFCCC (3rd session of the conference in the framework of climate change) in 1997. The protocol calls for a reduction of greenhouse gases, in particular CO2; it requires all parties to reduce their emissions by 5% below the level of the year 1990, for the period of 2008-2012 \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GOSAT\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: GOSAT\n      Long_Name: Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: IBUKI\n      Short_Name: 2009-002A\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: TANSO-FTS\n      Short_Name: TANSO-CAI\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 666 km\n      Repeat_Cycle: 3 days\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2010-08-24\n   Online_Resource: http://www.gosat.nies.go.jp/index_e.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gosat/index_e.html\n   Online_Resource: https://data.gosat.nies.go.jp/GosatUserInterfaceGateway/guig/GuigPage/open.do\n   Online_Resource: http://earth.esa.int/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=5096\n   Sample_Image: http://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gosat/img/photo-1_goast.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2009-01-23\n      Launch_Site: Tanegashima Island, Japan\n      Primary_Sponsor: JP/JAXA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

                                        "description": "CartoSat-2A is a follow-up optical imaging mission of CartoSat-2 (launch Jan. 10, 2007), representing India's first dedicated military satellite (funding by the Ministry of Defense of the Government of India). The overall objective is to provide scene-specific spot imagery in high resolution to the Indian Armed Forces - which is in the process of establishing an Aerospace Command.\n\nThe spacecraft and its payload, built by ISRO, is practically an identical copy of the CartoSat-2 spacecraft of ISRO. It features a lightweight and compact bus structure using the BMU (Bus Management Unit) for integrated bus functions (of the AOCS, TT&C, etc.). The spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized using high torque reaction wheels, magnetic torquers, and hydrazine thrusters. Attitude sensing is provided by a high performance star sensor and by an improved IRU (Inertial Reference Unit). The satellite is very agile providing a body-pointing capability in along-track and cross-track of up to \u00b145\u00ba (this supports a revisit capability of certain target regions within 4 days). Also use of the SPS (Satellite Positioning System), an 8-channel GPS receiver (C/A code) on-board for the provision of instantaneous state vectors (state vector using pseudo range and range rate measurements) for the spacecraft.\n\nThe fixed solar arrays (triple-junction solar cells) provide a power of 900 W when pointed toward the sun; two NiCd batteries of 18 Ah capacity are being used for ecliptic phase bridging.\n\nCartoSat-2A has a launch mass of 690 kg and a design life of 5 years. \n\nLaunch: The launch of CartoSat-2A took place on April 28, 2008 on a PSLV launcher. The launch was conducted from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota space station in southern India. Next to the primary payload of CartoSat-2A, the PSLV-C9 vehicle successfully launched the IMS-1 (Indian Microsatellite-1) of 83 kg and eight nanosatellites for international customers.\n\nSensor complement:\n\nPAN Camera (Panchromatic Camera). The objective is to provide imagery for cartographic applications. The optical system is designed with two mirror Ritchey-Chretien on-axis obscured reflective telescope system with a concave hyperboloidal primary mirror and convex hyperboloid secondary mirrors and the field correcting relay optics. The mirrors are made of special Zerodur glass and are light-weighted to about 60% as in CartoSat-1 series. The mirrors are mounted inside the telescope cylinder made of CFRP with special MFDs (Mirror Fixation Devices) and the whole telescope assembly is mounted to the spacecraft structure through a special suspension arrangement. The optical system is designed to provide < 1 m resolution across track. The along track GSD of < 1 m is achieved by apparent velocity reduction by a factor of 2.5.\n\nThe spacecraft can be suitably biased to provide various modes of imaging:\n\n1) Continuous strip monoscopic mode\n\n2) Spot scene imaging (strips on either side of the ground track can be imaged)\n\n3) Paint brush mode of imaging. This mode is used to increase the total swath. Both roll tilt and pitch tilt is employed.\n\nThe PAN Camera is a nadir-pointing pushbroom CCD instrument (detector line array of 12, 288 pixels), observing in the visible spectral range of 0.5-0.85 \u00b5m with a GSD (Ground Sample Distance) of < 1 m, and a swath width of 9.6 km at nadir. \n\nThe spacecraft is being monitored and controlled from the ISRO mission control center in Bangalore, India using the ISTRAC network of stations at Bangalore, Lucknow, Mauritius, Bearslake in Russia, Biak in Indonesia and Svalbard in Norway.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: CARTOSAT-2A\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: CARTOSAT-2A\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: PAN\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 635 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 97.94 degrees \n      Period: 97.4 minutes\n      Repeat_Cycle: 4 days\n      Perigee: 628.7 km\n      Apogee: 653.2 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-27\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=10000443\n   Online_Resource: http://www.isro.org/pslv-c9/cartosat2a.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://directory.eoportal.org/presentations/7336/CartoSat2A_Auto2.jpeg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2008-04-28\n      Launch_Site: Sriharikota Island, India\n      Design_Life: 5 YEARS\n      Primary_Sponsor: Ministry of Defense of the Government of India\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

UARS, the first satellite dedicated to studying stratospheric science, focuses on the processes that lead to ozone depletion, complementing and amplifying the measurements of total ozone made by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) onboard NASA's Nimbus-7 and the Russian Meteor-3 satellites. UARS also measures winds and temperatures in the stratosphere as well as the energy input from the Sun.  \n\nTen UARS instruments have provided the most complete data on upper atmospheric energy inputs, winds, and chemical composition ever gathered. Together, these observations constitute a highly integrated investigation of the nature of the upper atmosphere, and help define the role of the upper atmosphere in climate and climate variability. In its first two weeks of operation, UARS data confirmed the polar ozone-depletion theories by providing three-dimensional maps of ozone and chlorine monoxide near the South Pole during development of the 1991 ozone hole. UARS, developed and managed by GSFC, in Greenbelt, Md., provides information that nations around the world can use to guide decisions on environmental policies, according to scientists.  \n\nMoreover, UARS collected data on the chemistry, dynamics, and radiative inputs to the upper atmosphere far beyond its designed lifetime, obtaining over 13 years of observations for many atmospheric constituents, temperature, winds, and external forcings.  UARS was decommissioned in 2005. The United Kingdom and Canada both provided instruments for this mission.

It carried an altimeter that was capable of measuring the distance from satellite to sea surface with a relative precision of about 5 cm. Following a classified mission for the Navy, GEOSAT\u2019s scientific Exact Repeat Mission (ERM) began on November 8, 1986. During the ERM, GEOSAT was in a 17.05-day repeat orbit. In this orbit, the satellite passed the same point on the Earth every 17.05 days to gather important information on sea level change and ocean variability.\n\nWhen the ERM ended in January 1990 from failure of both its on-board tape recorders, more than three years of precise altimeter data were available to the scientific community. The studies made using GEOSAT data are numerous and the GEOSAT data set is regarded as a milestone in both satellite oceanography and satellite geodesy.",

On November 8, 1986, the\nsatellite was moved into an Exact Repeat Mission (ERM) orbit with a repeat\ncycle of 17.05 days. The GEOSAT mission was originally managed by the Office of\nNaval Research (ONR). During the development phase, the program responsibility\nwas transferred to the Naval Electronics Systems Command, now called the Space\nand Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in Washington, D.C. The Applied\nPhysics Laboratory (APL) was the prime contractor for the spacecraft and radar\naltimeter and performed spacecraft command and control operations and collected\nthe satellite data. The data was distributed to the Naval Surface Weapons\nCenter (NSWC), the Naval Ocean Research and Development Activity (NORDA), and\nNOAA. An arrangement was made with the National Ocean Service of NOAA to obtain\nthe classified GEOSAT geophysical data records (GDR) providing wind, wave and\nsea-level products and made available to the user community. NASA obtained\nGEOSAT data for extensive waveform modeling and ice sheet research.The basic\nstructure of the GEOSAT is similar to the GEOS-3 satellite: The design consists\nof a conical structure below the core for the structural attachment of the\nvelocity control system. The GEOSAT attitude control subsystem was designed to\npoint the radar altimeter to within 1 degree of nadir 98 percent of the time.\nThe system components were a 20-foot scissors boom with 100-pound end mass,\nredundant momentum wheels for roll and yaw stiffness, and pitch and roll\nattitude control thrusters. Attitude sensing was provided through the use of\nthree digital sun-attitude detectors and a three-axis vector magnetometer.\nSpacecraft command was accomplished via a VHF uplink from the APL ground\nstation. The telemetry subsystem consisted of two S-band transmitters, two tape\nrecorders, and two encryption units. The GEOSAT was equipped with two Odetics\ndual-track high-density tape recorders that independently recorded the 10.205\nkbps telemetry stream and played it back at 833 kbps for transmission to the\nground. The GEOSAT also included redundant Doppler beacons for continuous\ntracking by a network of ground stations within the Defense Mapping Agency\n(DMA) and for a source of accurate timing to the radar altimeter and the\ntelemetry subsystem. A C-band transponder was also included on GEOSAT.

The long trailing solar panel at the rear gives the satellite an overall length of 19 m. The solar panel is made up of five sections and covers an area of 21 sq m and, at the satellite\u2019s low orbital altitude, helps minimise atmospheric drag.\n\nEarthCARE will orbit Earth at an altitude of around 393 km. The altitude needs to be as low as possible to optimise the use of the lidar and radar, but not too low where atmospheric drag would impact fuel consumption and the life of the mission.\n\nSince global coverage is required, EarthCARE\u2019s orbit is near-polar. It crosses the equator in the early afternoon, providing optimal illumination and minimal sun glint for the passive instruments.\n\nThe system\u2019s power demand is significant. The two active instruments, the Atmospheric Lidar (ATLID) and the CPR, require 2500 W.\n\nThe size of the satellite (with solar panel and CPR antenna stowed for launch) and its mass of about 2000 kg plus fuel makes it compatible with both Soyuz and Zenit launchers.",

Plans include sending a copy of the SAGE III instrument to the International Space Station aboard a commercial Space X flight.\n\nSAGE III was a fourth generation, satellite-borne instrument and a crucial element in NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) . The instrument was launched on the Russian Meteor-3M spacecraft in December 2001. The Meteor-3M mission, along with the SAGE III mission, was terminated on March 6, 2006, because of a power supply system failure resulting in loss of communication with the satellite.\n\nThe SAGE III mission enhanced our understanding of natural and human-derived atmospheric processes by providing accurate measurements of the vertical structure of aerosols, ozone, water vapor, and other important trace gases in the upper troposphere and stratosphere.\n\nHuman-derived changes in climate and ozone threaten the health of our planet. They also threaten global economic development and the use of new technologies like high-speed aircraft.\n\nBy understanding the effect of human activities on the atmosphere, national and international leaders can make informed policy that mitigates or prepares for future climate change.\n\nThe SAGE III-Meteor-3M Version 3 revised data set, which includes improvements to solar ozone, nitrogen dioxide and aerosol extinction products, is publicly available at NASA Langley's Atmospheric Science Data Center . The data set also includes the release of a cloud presence identifier and lunar data products. These data will cover the period 27 February 2002 - Present. IDL users will need to access the reader software that must be matched with this version of the data set.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: SAGE-III\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: SAGE-III\n      Long_Name: Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment-III\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: ISS\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2012-01-27\n   Online_Resource: http://www-sage3.larc.nasa.gov/\n   Sample_Image: http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/SAGEIII/Images/SAGE_orbit.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Design_Life: 3 Years\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: Russian Space Agency\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The Meteor-2\ninstrumentation consists of (1) three television-type visible and\ninfrared scanners, (2) an 8-channel scanning radiometer, and (3) a\nradiation-flux device for measuring radiation flux densities in\nnear-space. The two visible scanners operate in the 0.5-0.7 micrometer\nregion and has a swath width of 2100 and 2400 km at a resolution of 2\nand 1 km, respectively. These scanners provide images and mosaics of\narctic and antarctic oceans. The IR scanner operates in the 8-12\nmicrometer range with a swath width of 2600 km at a resolution of 8\nkm. The IR scanner provides imagery of clouds and surface. The\n8-channel infrared radiometer operates in the 11.1 to 18.7 micrometer\nrange with a swath of 1000 km at 30 km resolution.

The Meteor satellites were designed to monitor atmospheric and sea-surface temperatures, humidity, radiation, sea-ice conditions, snow-cover, and clouds.\n\nWhat makes Meteor 2-21 distinctive from the other meteorological satellites is its unique retroreflector array. Fizeau is named after a French physicist, Armand Fizeau, who in 1851 conducted an experiment which tested for the aether convection coefficient. SLR tracking of this satellite was used for precise orbit determination and the Experiment of Fizeau. The Fizeau Experiment tests the theory of special relativity-that distance events that are simultaneous for one observer will not be simultaneous for an observer in motion relative to the first.\nMission Instrumentation:\n\nMeteor-2-21/Fizeau had the following instrumentation onboard:\n\n   1. Scanning telephotometer\n   2. Scanning infrared radiometers\n   3. Radiation measurement complex\n   4.

The Meteor-3 class of satellites orbit in a higher altitude than the Meteor-2 class of satellites thus providing more complete coverage of the earth's surface. The Meteor-3 has the same payload as the Meteor-2 but also includes an advanced scanning radiometer with better spectral and spatial resolution and a spectrometer for determining total ozone content. The spacecraft incorporates three-axis stabilization (0.5 deg accuracy) and twin 10-m span solar panels. The orbit is adjusted by ion thrusters. Meteorological data is transmitted to four primary sites in the former Soviet Union in conjunction with about 80 other smaller sites. Internationally compatible Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) is made available on 137 - 138 MHz channels to ground workstations. The Meteor-3 has two 0.5 - 0.7 micron radiometers. The first provides direct relay with a swath width of 2600 km and a resolution of 1 x 2 km. The second stores data on an on-board data recorder providing global coverage with a swath width of 3100 km and a resolution of 0.7 x 1.4 km. The payload also includes a scanning IR radiometer at 10.5 - 12.5 microns with a swath width of 3100 km and resolution of 3 x 3 km and an 8-channel IR radiometer for atmospheric sounding at 9.65 - 18.7 micorns with a swath width of 2000 km and a resolution of 32 x 32 km. The Meteor-3 also includes a 4 channel UV ozone monitor (0.25 - 1.03 micron) at 2 km altitude resolution and a particle radiation detector (0.15 - 90 MeV). \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: METEOR-3\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: METEOR\n      Short_Name: METEOR-3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: TOMS\n      Short_Name: PHOTOMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-10-11\n   Online_Resource: http://www.astronautix.com/craft/meteor3.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://www.astronautix.com/graphics/m/meteor3e.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1991-08-15\n      Launch_Site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia\n      Design_Life: 2 Years\n      Primary_Sponsor: Russia\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The spacecraft was successfully launched into a nearly polar, highly elliptical orbit.  It was folded and carried into orbit, together with ejection and inflation equipment, as part of the payload of Explorer 40.  Two density experiments were performed.  One involved the study of systematic density variation, and the other was concerned with nonsystematic density changes.  The upper atmospheric densities were derived from sequential observations of the sphere by use of an attached 136.620-MHz radio tracking beacon and by optical tracking. The radio beacon ceased transmitting in June 1971.  Since that time it has been necessary to rely solely on the SAO Baker-Nunn camera network for tracking.  Explorer 39 had an expected orbital lifetime of 50 years.\n\nhttps://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1968-066A\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: AD-C\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: AD (Atmospheric Dynamics)\n      Short_Name: AD-C\n      Long_Name: Atmosphere Dynamics C (Explorer 39)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: EXPLORER 39\n      Short_Name: 03337\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: OPTICAL BEACON\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 80.6 degrees\n      Period: 118.2 minutes\n      Perigee: 670 km\n      Apogee: 2538 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-08-22\n   Online_Resource: https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1968-066A\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1968-08-08\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Explorer 24 was identical in configuration to the previously launched balloon satellites Explorer 9 and 19.  The spacecraft was 3.6 m in diameter, was built of alternating layers of aluminum foil and plastic film, and was covered uniformly with 5.1-cm white dots for thermal control.  It was designed to yield atmospheric density near perigee as a function of space and time from sequential observations of the sphere's position in orbit.  To facilitate ground tracking, the satellite carried a 136-MHz tracking beacon.

Accurate climate model predictions will provide international and national leaders accurate information to make more informed policy decisions about global climate change.\n\nCALIPSO flies a 3-channel lidar with a suite of passive instruments in formation with Aqua to obtain coincident observations of radiative fluxes and atmospheric conditions. This enables new observationally based assessments of the radiative effects of aerosol and clouds that will greatly improve out ability to predict future climate change.\n\nCloudSat also flies in formation with CALIPSO to provide a comprehensive characterization of the structure and composition of clouds and their effects on climate under all weather conditions.

One major objective of GARP was to obtain synoptic global meteorological data sets for one year's duration (to include two optimized observing periods of a few weeks each).  These data served as raw material to optimize computer models for meteorological prediction.  It was hoped that determination could be made of the time limitation for short-term modeling.  The GMS series has been used for the World Meteorological Organization's World Weather Watch. The satellite was spin-stabilized with a despun earth-pointing antenna.  The GMS series carried the Visible and Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR).  Launched by a US Delta rocket in July 1977, the satellite was positioned near 140 deg E.  Designed to operate for 5 years, the satellite was turned off in 1981 after 4 1/2 years in orbit.\n__________\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage (SIRS).

The sounder used\ntwo dipole antennas (73 and 18.7 m long). The satellite was spin-stabilized at\nabout 2.9 rpm after antenna deployment. Some control was exercised over the\nspin rate and attitude by using magnetically induced torques to change the spin\nrate and to precess the spin axis. A tape recorder with 1-h capacity was\nincluded on the satellite. The satellite could be programmed to take recorded\nobservations for four different time periods for each full recording period.\nThe recorder data were dumped only at Ottawa. For non-tape-recorded\nobservations, data for the satellite and subsatellite regions could be acquired\nand telemetered when the spacecraft was in the line of sight of telemetry\nstations. The selected telemetry stations were in areas that provided primary\ndata coverage near the 80-deg-W meridian and in areas near Hawaii, Singapore,\nAustralia, England, Norway, India, Japan, Antarctica, New Zealand, and Central\nAfrica. NASA support of the ISIS project was terminated on October 1, 1979. A\nsignificant amount of experimental data, however, was acquired after this date\nby the Canadian project team. ISIS 1 operations were terminated in Canada on\nMarch 9, 1984. The Radio Research Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan) then requested\nand received permission to reactivate ISIS 1. Regular ISIS 1 operations were\nstarted from Kashima, Japan, in early August 1984.

Two long crossed-dipole antennas (73 and 18.7 m) were used for the\nsounding, VLF, and cosmic noise experiments. The spacecraft was spin-stabilized\nto about 2 rpm after antenna deployment. There were two basic orientation modes\nfor the spacecraft, cartwheel and orbit-aligned. The spacecraft operated\napproximately the same length of time in each mode, remaining in one mode\ntypically 3 to 5 months. The cartwheel mode with the axis perpendicular to the\norbit plane was made available to provide ram and wake data for some\nexperiments for each spin period, rather than for each orbit period. Attitude\nand spin information was obtained from a three-axis magnetometer and a sun\nsensor. Control of attitude and spin was possible by means of magnetic\ntorquing. The experiment package also included a programmable tape recorder\nwith a 1-h capacity. For nonrecorded observations, data from satellite and\nsubsatellite regions were telemetered when the spacecraft was in the line of\nsight of a telemetry station. Telemetry stations were located so that primary\ndata coverage was near the 80-deg-W meridian and near Hawaii, Singapore,\nAustralia, England, France, Norway, India, Japan, Antarctica, New Zealand, and\nCentral Africa. NASA support of the ISIS project was terminated on October 1,\n1979. A significant amount of experimental data, however, was acquired after\nthis date by the Canadian project team. ISIS 2 operations were terminated in\nCanada on March 9, 1984. The Radio Research Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan) then\nrequested and received permission to reactivate ISIS 2. Regular ISIS 2\noperations were started from Kashima, Japan, in early August 1984. ISIS 2 was\ndeactivated effective 24, 1990.\n                  - Auxiliary Information -\n    Launch Date and Time :  1971-04-01 02:53:00\n    Epoch Date and Time  :  1971-04-02\n    Apogee (km or AU):      1428.\n    Perigee (km or AU):     1358.\n    Inclination (degree) :  88.1\n    Orbit Type :            Geocentric\n    Information last updated on 1992-03-09\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: ISIS-2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: ISIS (International Satellite for Ionospheric S\n      Short_Name: ISIS-2\n      Long_Name: International Satellite for Ionospheric Studies-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: ISIS-B\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: PHOTOMETERS\n      Short_Name: PARTICLE DETECTORS\n      Short_Name: VLF RECEIVERS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 88.1 deg\n      Perigee: 1358 km\n      Apogee: 1428 km\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-10-05\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1971-024A\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1971-04-01 \n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

This is the only method that has the potential to provide the required data globally, from direct wind observations. In addition, a DWL will provide information on cloud top heights, vertical distribution of cloud, aerosol properties, and wind variability. This information is a useful by-product of the DWL method.\n\nAn improved model of the Earth's climate and atmosphere will lead to progress in numerical weather prediction (NWP), especially concerning long-term forecasting. It is widely recognised that a new global atmospheric observing system, such as Aeolus, will have a great effect upon operational weather forecasting. The provision of detailed wind profiles will also benefit scientists involved with climate research, allowing for greater accuracy in the numerical modelling of tropical regions in particular. \n\nThe Aeolus mission was launched on 22 August 2018.",

GOES-9, which is currently\npartially operational, is being provided to the Japanese Meteorological\nAgency to replace their failing geostationary satellite.\n\nGOES I-M represents the next generation of meteorological satellites\nand introduces two new features.  The first feature, flexible scan,\noffers small-scale area imaging that lets meteorologists take pictures\nof local weather trouble spots. This allows them to improve short-term\nforecasts over local areas. The second feature, simultaneous and\nindependent imaging and sounding, is designed to allow weather\nforecasters to use multiple measurements of weather phenomena to\nincrease the accuracy of their forecasts.\n\nEach satellite in the series carries two major instruments: an Imager\nand a Sounder. These instruments acquire high resolution visible and\ninfrared data, as well as temperature and moisture profiles of the\natmosphere. They continuously transmit these data to ground terminals\nwhere the data are processed for rebroadcast to primary weather\nservices both in the United States and around the world, including the\nglobal research community.\n\nThe GOES I-M mission is scheduled to run from the mid-1990s into the\nfirst decade of the 21st century.  Each element of the mission has\nbeen designed to meet all in-orbit performance requirements for at\nleast five years.\nThe GOES I-M system performs the following basic functions:\n+ Acquisition, processing, and dissemination of imaging and\nsounding data.\n+ Acquisition and dissemination of Space Environment Monitor\n(SEM) data.\n+ Reception and relay of data from ground-based Data Collection\nPlatforms (DCPs) that are situated in carefully selected urban and\nremote areas to the NOAA Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) station.\n+ Continuous relay of Weather Facsimile (WEFAX) and other data to\nusers, independent of all other functions.\n+ Relay of distress signals from people, aircraft, or marine vessels\nto the search and rescue ground stations of the Search and Rescue\nSatellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) system.\nGOES provides the instantaneous relay functions for the SARSAT system.\nA dedicated search and rescue transponder on board GOES is designed to\ndetect emergency distress signals originating from Earth-based\nsources. These unique identification signals are normally combined\nwith signals received by a low-Earth orbiting satellite system and\nrelayed to a search and rescue ground terminal. The combined data are\nused to perform effective search and rescue operations.\nThe GOES I-M system serves a region covering the central and eastern\nPacific Ocean; North, Central, and South America; and the central and\nwestern Atlantic Ocean. Pacific coverage includes Hawaii and the Gulf\nof Alaska. This is accomplished by two satellites, GOES West located\nat 135 west longitude and GOES East at 75 west longitude. A common\nground station, the CDA station located at Wallops, Virginia,\nsupports the interface to both satellites. The NOAA Satellite\nOperations Control Center (SOCC), in Suitland, Maryland, provides\nspacecraft scheduling, health and safety monitoring, and engineering\nanalyses.\n\nDelivery of products involves ground processing of the raw instrument\ndata for radiometric calibration and Earth location information, and\nretransmission to the satellite for relay to the data user community.\nThe processed data are received at the control center and disseminated\nto the National Weather Service's (NWS) National Meteorological\nCenter, Camp Springs, Maryland, and NWS forecast offices, including\nthe National Hurricane Center, Miami, Florida, and the National Severe\nStorms Forecast Center, Kansas City, Missouri. Processed data are also\nreceived by Department of Defense installations, universities, and\nnumerous private commercial users.\n*The GOES-9 satellite was replaced by GOES-10 in July 1998*\n\nMAIN SPACECRAFT DESIGN ELEMENTS\nMission life            5 years, minimum\nDimensions\n Main body              2 meter (7 foot) cube\n Deployed length        27 meters (88 feet)\nWeight                  2100 kg (4600 lb)\nOrbit                   Geosynchronous\n Altitude               36,000 km (22,000 mi)\n Longitude              75W and 135W\n Latitude               equatorial, within 0.5 degree\nPower                   1050 watts &#64 42 volts, solar array; battery\nbackup\nLaunch vehicle          Atlas-I/Centaur (GOES-I/K), Atlas-II/Centaur\n(GOES-L/M)\nCommunications          Imager and Sounder in GVAR format at 2.1\nMbits/sec\nGOES-I/M IMAGER\nThe GOES Imager is a multi-channel instrument designed to sense\nradiant and solar-reflected energy from sampled areas of the\nEarth.

The instrument can produce full-Earth\ndisc images, sector images that contain the edges of the Earth, and\nvarious sizes of area scans completely enclosed within the Earth scene\nusing a new flexible scan system.

                                        "description": "GOES 8 (GOES-I) was launched on April 13, 1994. On Tuesday April 1,\n2003 GOES-12 (Formerly Referred to as GOES-M) replaced GOES-8 as the\noperational GOES East Satellite. NOAA deactivated the satellite on May\n5, 2004 and will boost it into an orbit 350 kilometers above its\noriginal geostationary position, where it will be disposed safely in\nthree controlled burns.\n\nGOES I-M represented the next generation of meteorological satellites\nand introduces two new features.  The first feature, flexible scan,\noffers small-scale area imaging that lets meteorologists take pictures\nof local weather trouble spots. This allows them to improve short-term\nforecasts over local areas. The second feature, simultaneous and\nindependent imaging and sounding, is designed to allow weather\nforecasters to use multiple measurements of weather phenomena to\nincrease the accuracy of their forecasts.\n\nEach satellite in the series carries two major instruments: an Imager\nand a Sounder. These instruments acquire high resolution visible and\ninfrared data, as well as temperature and moisture profiles of the\natmosphere. They continuously transmit these data to ground terminals\nwhere the data are processed for rebroadcast to primary weather\nservices both in the United States and around the world, including the\nglobal research community.\n\nThe GOES I-M mission ran from the mid-1990s into the\nfirst decade of the 21st century.  Each element of the mission has\nbeen designed to meet all in-orbit performance requirements for at\nleast five years.\n\nThe GOES I-M system performed the following basic functions:\n+ Acquisition, processing, and dissemination of imaging and\nsounding data.\n+ Acquisition and dissemination of Space Environment Monitor\n(SEM) data.\n+ Reception and relay of data from ground-based Data Collection\nPlatforms (DCPs) that are situated in carefully selected urban and\nremote areas to the NOAA Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) station.\n+ Continuous relay of Weather Facsimile (WEFAX) and other data to\nusers, independent of all other functions.\n+ Relay of distress signals from people, aircraft, or marine vessels\nto the search and rescue ground stations of the Search and Rescue\nSatellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) system.\nGOES provides the instantaneous relay functions for the SARSAT system.\nA dedicated search and rescue transponder on board GOES is designed to\ndetect emergency distress signals originating from Earth-based\nsources. These unique identification signals are normally combined\nwith signals received by a low-Earth orbiting satellite system and\nrelayed to a search and rescue ground terminal. The combined data are\nused to perform effective search and rescue operations.\nThe GOES I-M system serves a region covering the central and eastern\nPacific Ocean; North, Central, and South America; and the central and\nwestern Atlantic Ocean. Pacific coverage includes Hawaii and the Gulf\nof Alaska. This is accomplished by two satellites, GOES West located\nat 135 west longitude and GOES East at 75 west longitude.

                                        "description": "GOES satellites provide the kind of continuous monitoring necessary\nfor intensive data analysis. They circle the Earth in a geosynchronous\norbit, which means they orbit the equatorial plane of the Earth at a\nspeed matching the Earth's rotation. This allows them to hover\ncontinuously over one position on the surface. The geosynchronous\nplane is about 35,800 km (22,300 miles) above the Earth, high enough\nto allow the satellites a full-disc view of the Earth. Because they\nstay above a fixed spot on the surface, they provide a constant vigil\nfor the atmospheric \"triggers\" for severe weather conditions such as\ntornadoes, flash floods, hail storms, and hurricanes. When these\nconditions develop the GOES satellites are able to monitor storm\ndevelopment and track their movements.\n\nGOES satellite imagery is also used to estimate rainfall during the\nthunderstorms and hurricanes for flash flood warnings, as well as\nestimates snowfall accumulations and overall extent of snow\ncover. Such data help meteorologists issue winter storm warnings and\nspring snow melt advisories. Satellite sensors also detect ice fields\nand map the movements of sea and lake ice.\n\nNASA launched the first GOES for NOAA in 1975 and followed it with\nanother in 1977. Currently, the United States is operating GOES-10 and\nGOES-12. (GOES-9, which is partially operational, is being provided to\nthe Japanese Meteorological Agency to replace their failing\ngeostationary satellite.) GOES-11 is being stored in orbit as a\nreplacement for GOES-12 or GOES-10 in the event of failure.\n\nAdditional Information on GOES Satellites:\n\"http://www.oso.noaa.gov/goes/\"\n\nTo view a 3D orbit of GOES satellites, observe the J Track\nsatellite tracking web page at:\n\"http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/\"\n\n[Summary Extracted from the NOAA Office of Satellite Operations Home Page]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GOES\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite)\n      Short_Name: GOES\n      Long_Name: NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: GOES-1\n      Short_Name: GOES-2\n      Short_Name: GOES-3\n      Short_Name: GOES-4\n      Short_Name: GOES-5\n      Short_Name: GOES-6\n      Short_Name: GOES-7\n      Short_Name: GOES-8\n      Short_Name: GOES-9\n      Short_Name: GOES-10\n      Short_Name: GOES-11\n      Short_Name: GOES-12\n      Short_Name: GOES-13\n      Short_Name: GOES-N\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SEM\n      Short_Name: SAR\n      Short_Name: HEPAD\n      Short_Name: MAGNETOMETERS\n      Short_Name: VAS\n      Short_Name: VISSR\n      Short_Name: GOES I-M SOUNDER\n      Short_Name: GOES I-M IMAGER\n      Short_Name: SXI\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 35,800 km (22,300 miles)\n      Orbit_Inclination: 0.41 degrees\n      Period: 1,436 minutes\n      Repeat_Cycle: GOES flies in an orbit above the equator at the same rate as the equator turns -- one cycle per day.\n      Apogee: 400 000 km (240 000 mi)\n      Orbit_Type: GEO > Geosynchronous > Geostationary\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-05-08\n   Online_Resource: http://www.oso.noaa.gov/goes/\n   Online_Resource: http://www.goes.noaa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://goes.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://goespoes.gsfc.nasa.gov/goes/index.html\n   Online_Resource: http://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/goes/text/goes.databook.html\n   Online_Resource: http://goes.gsfc.nasa.gov/text/goesfaq.html\n   Sample_Image: http://goes.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/thenextgeneration.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Design_Life: 7 to 11 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NOAA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The GOES-NEXT series is a joint effort on the part of NASA and NOAA to provide continued operational monitoring of weather systems primarily over the United States, distribute meteorological data to regional and national weather offices within the USA, contribute to the development of an environmental data collection network, contribute to the search and rescue program, improve the capability for forcasting and provide real-time warnings of solar distrubances, and to extend knowledge and understanding of atmospheric processes to improve short and long-term weather forecasts.\n\nThe GOES-NEXT series extends the capabilities of the previous GOES 1-7 spacecraft. The GOES I-M spacecraft will be placed over the equator at 135 deg West or 75 deg West. The design allows unobstructed views of the Earth for operational coverage by the spacecraft sensors. The spacecraft configuration is a compact box-shaped main body that carries the Earth-observing instruments, a continuous-drive solar array attached to the south panel through a yoke assembly, and a solar pointing instrument gimbal mounted on the solar panel yoke. The main body accomodates the sensors, electronics, and support subsystems. The communication antennas, except the Tracking, Telemetry, and Command (TT&C) antenna, are hard-mounted to the Earth-facing panel. The Propulsion Module consists of the fuel and oxidizer tanks for the bipropellant propulsion subsystem mounted on the central cylinder. The Attitude and Orbit Control Substem (AOCS) provides attitude control of the spacecraft. The AOCS consists of the sensors, electronics, and the actuators. The GOES power is generated from the solar array and two 12 A-hr batteries. Power is automatically regulated during solar eclipses. A conical shaped solar sail at the end of a 58-foot boom balances torque caused by solar radiation. The main body of the spacecraft is a 2-meter cube. In its deployed orbit configuration, the overall length is about 27 meters. Initial mass was about 4640 pounds, including fuel. Design lifetime is about five years.\n\nThe Image Navigation/Registration (INR) system provides Imager and Sounder data products in real-time to users. The Communications, Command, and Data Handling subsystem is comprised of antennas, receivers, transponders, transmitters, data encoders and encryptors and multiplexers. The Tracking Telemetry and Command (TT&C) subsystem provides the necessary monitor and command link between the spacecraft and the ground stations.\n\nThe GOES-NEXT instruments consist of the following: (1) Earth Imaging System, a 5-channel visible and infrared radiometer which provides Earth imagery 24 hours a day; (2) Sounding System, a 19-channel discrete-filter radiometer for obtaining atmospheric temperature and moisture soundings; (3) a Space Environment Monitor (SEM), which consists of a magnetic field sensor, a solar X-ray sensor, an energetic particle sensor (EPS), and a High Energy Proton and Alpha Detector (HEPAD); (4) a Search and Rescue subsystem (SARSAT), which receives signals from 406 MHz distress beacons and relays them to the ground; (5) a Data Collection System (DCS) for collecting and relaying real-time information from Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) such as buoys, balloons, remote weather stations, ships, and aircraft; and (6) a Weather Facsimile (WEFAX) system which relays processed weather imagary from the Wallops Island station to the user community. The SEC package has been frequently eratic during 2003.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GOES-10\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite)\n      Short_Name: GOES-10\n      Long_Name: Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 10\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: GOES-10\n      Short_Name: 24786\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: GOES I-M IMAGER\n      Short_Name: GOES I-M SOUNDER\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Type: GEO > Geosynchronous > Geostationary\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-10-03\n   Online_Resource: http://www.oso.noaa.gov/goes/\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1997-019A\n   Online_Resource: http://goes.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Sample_Image: http://library01.gsfc.nasa.gov/gdprojs/images/goes_2.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1997-04-25\n      Launch_Site: CAPE CANAVERAL/KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NOAA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

This spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer, meteorological data collection and relay system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer.  On December 1, 1978, responsibility for GOES 1 was turned over to ESA to be used as part of FGGE/GARP.  It was stationed over the Indian Ocean and controlled by ESOC in Darmstadt, F.R.G.  In December 1979, it was returned to the control of NOAA and positioned at 135 degrees West.  When GOES 5 VAS experienced a failure on July 30, 1984, GOES 6 was moved east and GOES 1 was reactivated by NOAA to provide visible imaging capability over the western U.S.  GOES 1 failed on February 3, 1985. \n\nAdditional Information on GOES Satellites: http://www.oso.noaa.gov/goes/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GOES-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite)\n      Short_Name: GOES-1\n      Long_Name: Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: SMS-3\n      Short_Name: GOES-A\n      Short_Name: SMS-C\n      Short_Name: 8366\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SEM\n      Short_Name: VISSR\n      Short_Name: EPM\n      Short_Name: SXM\n      Short_Name: DCS\n      Short_Name: Magnetic Field Monitor\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Type: GEO > Geosynchronous > Geostationary\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1975-100A\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1975-10-16\n      Launch_Site: CAPE CANAVERAL/KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NOAA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell. The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube.  The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft.  A support structure extended radially out from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment.  Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command.  The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem.  A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit.\n\nThe spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer atmospheric sounder, meteorological data collection and transmission system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer.  It operated at 100 degrees West initially, but replaced GOES 3 at 135 degrees West in March 1981.  When GOES 5 VAS experienced a failure on July 30, 1984, GOES 4 was reactivated by NOAA to provide GOES 1 VISSR data relay services to western users.\n\nMore information about GOES Satellites:\nhttp://www.oso.noaa.gov/goes/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GOES-4\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite)\n      Short_Name: GOES-4\n      Long_Name: Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 4\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: GOES D\n      Short_Name: 11964\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SXM\n      Short_Name: VAS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Type: GEO > Geosynchronous > Geostationary\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-10-04\n   Online_Resource: http://www.oso.noaa.gov/goes/\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1980-074A\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1980-09-09\n      Launch_Site: CAPE CANAVERAL/KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NOAA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The OCO science objective is to provide global measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) needed to describe the geographic distribution and variability of carbon dioxide sources and sinks. CO2 measurements are essential to resolving significant discrepancies in our understanding of the global carbon budget and, hence, humankind's role in global climate change.\n\nThe Orbiting Carbon Observatory, a mission that partners with industry and academia, will generate knowledge needed to improve projections of future carbon dioxide levels within Earth's atmosphere. Increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have raised concerns about global warming. Even though the biosphere and oceans are currently absorbing about half of the CO2 generated by human activities, the nature and geographic distribution of these CO2 sinks are too poorly understood to predict their response to future climate and land-use changes. The OCO mission is led and managed by JPL (PI: David Crisp). The project includes more than 19 universities as well as corporate and international partners (investigators from the USA, France, Germany, New Zealand, and Australia).",

Some quick facts about OCO-3 are:\n\n- OCO-3 is a critical element in the continuation of global carbon dioxide (CO2) measurements focused on understanding the regional sources and sinks of CO2 from the unique vantage point of the International Space Station (ISS).\n\n- OCO-3 can also contribute to focused studies of how space based measurements can constrain rapidly changing anthropogenic (man-made) emissions. Anthropogenic emissions could be the largest source of uncertainty in the global carbon budget as OCO-3 measurements reduce uncertainty of natural fluxes. OCO-3 has the ability to makes measurements at different times of the day.\n\n- OCO-3 measurements can be combined with evapotranspiration and biomass measurements, such as those from other ISS instruments ECOSTRESS and GEDI, to study process details of the terrestrial ecosystem.\n\n- OCO-2 has demonstrated that atmospheric XCO2 can be measured from space with precision of better than 1 ppm. OCO-3 is expected to have similar performance. \n\nMore Information: https://ocov3.jpl.nasa.gov/",

NOAA-20 is the first of the JPSS Series. Polar orbiting satellites constantly circle the Earth in an almost north-south orbit, passing close to both poles.\n\nThe POES satellite system offers the advantage of daily global coverage, by making nearly polar orbits 14 times per day approximately 520 miles above the surface of the Earth. The Earth's rotation allows the satellite to see a different view with each orbit, and each satellite provides two complete views of weather around the world each day. NOAA partners with the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) to constantly operate two polar-orbiting satellites \u2013 one POES and one European polar-orbiting satellite called Metop.\n\nThe POES instruments include the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument and the Advanced TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (ATOVS) suite. The EUMETSAT-provided Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) instrument completes the ATOVS suite. The AVHRR/ATOVS provides visible, infrared, and microwave data which is used for a variety of applications such as cloud and precipitation monitoring, determination of surface properties, and humidity profiles.\n\nData from the POES series supports a broad range of environmental monitoring applications including weather analysis and forecasting, climate research and prediction, global sea surface temperature measurements, atmospheric soundings of temperature and humidity, ocean dynamics research, volcanic eruption monitoring, forest fire detection, global vegetation analysis, search and rescue, and many other applications.\n\nThe orbits are circular, with an altitude between 830 (morning orbit) and 870 (afternoon orbit) km, and are sun synchronous. One satellite crosses the equator at 7:30 a.m. local time, the other at 1:40 p.m. local time. The circular orbit permits uniform data acquisition by the satellite and efficient control of the satellite by the NOAA Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) stations located near Fairbanks, Alaska and Wallops Island, Virginia. Operating as pair, these satellites ensure that data for any region of the Earth are no more than six hours old.\n\nA suite of instruments is able to measure many parameters of the Earth's atmosphere, its surface, cloud cover, incoming solar protons, positive ions, electron-flux density, and the energy spectrum at the satellite altitude. As a part of the mission, the satellites can receive, process and retransmit data from Search and Rescue beacon transmitters, and automatic data collection platforms on land, ocean buoys, or aboard free-floating balloons.",

The satellite was equipped with three curved solar panels that\nwere folded during launch and deployed after orbit was achieved. Each\npanel measured over 4.2 m in length when unfolded and was covered with\napproximately 3500 solar cells measuring 2 by 2 cm. The dynamics and\nattitude control system maintained desired spacecraft orientation\nthrough gyroscopic principles incorporated into the satellite\ndesign. Earth orientation of the satellite body was maintained by\ntaking advantage of the precession induced from a momentum flywheel so\nthat the satellite body precession rate of one revolution per orbit\nprovided the desired 'earth-looking' attitude. Minor adjustments in\nattitude and orientation were made by means of magnetic coils and by\nvarying the speed of the momentum flywheel.\nThe primary sensors consisted of a Very High Resolution Radiometer\n(VHRR), Vertical Temperature Profile Radiometer (VTPR), and a Scanning\nRadiometer (SR).\n__________\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage (SIRS).

NOAA-2 was not equipped with conventional TV cameras. It was\nthe first operational weather satellite to rely solely upon\nradiometric imaging to obtain cloudcover data.  The primary objective\nwas to provide global daytime and nighttime direct readout real-time\ncloudcover data on a daily basis. The sun-synchronous spacecraft was\nalso capable of supplying global atmospheric temperature soundings and\nvery high resolution infrared cloudcover data for selected areas in\neither a direct readout or a tape-recorder mode. A secondary objective\nwas to obtain global solar-proton flux data on a real-time daily\nbasis.  The sensors were mounted on the satellite baseplate with their\noptical axes directed vertically earthward. The nearly cubical\nspacecraft measured 1 by 1 by 1.2 m. The satellite was equipped with\nthree curved solar panels that were folded during launch and deployed\nafter orbit was achieved. Each panel measured over 4.2 m in length\nwhen unfolded and was covered with approximately 3500 solar cells\nmeasuring 2 by 2 cm. The dynamics and attitude control system\nmaintained desired spacecraft orientation through gyroscopic\nprinciples incorporated into the satellite design. Earth orientation\nof the satellite body was maintained by taking advantage of the\nprecession induced from a momentum flywheel so that the satellite body\nprecession rate of one revolution per orbit provided the desired\n'earth-looking' attitude. Minor adjustments in attitude and\norientation were made by means of magnetic coils and by varying the\nspeed of the momentum flywheel.\nThe primary sensors consisted of a Very High Resolution Radiometer\n(VHRR), Vertical Temperature Profile Radiometer (VTPR), and a Scanning\nRadiometer (SR).  The spacecraft operated satisfactorily until March\n18, 1974, when the VTPR failed. NOAA-2 was then placed in a marginal\nstandby mode from March 19 to July 1, 1974. It was then used as the\noperational NOAA satellite until October 16, 1974, when it was again\nplaced in a marginal standby mode. The spacecraft was deactivated on\nJanuary 30, 1975.\n\nMore Information about NOAA-2:\nhttps://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1972-082A\n__________\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage (SIRS).

The satellite design provides an economical and stable sun-synchronous (morning equator-crossing) platform for advanced operational instruments to measure the earth's atmosphere, its surface and cloud cover, and the near-space environment. Primary sensors include an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) for observing daytime and nighttime global radiances and temperatures and a TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) for obtaining temperature and water vapor profiles through the earth's atmosphere. Secondary experiments consist of a Space Environment Monitor (SEM), which measures the proton and electron fluxes near the earth, and an ARGOS Data Collection and Location System, which processes and relays to central data acquisition stations the various meteorological data received from free-floating balloons and ocean buoys distributed around the globe. The satellite is based upon the Block 5D spacecraft bus developed for the U.S. Air Force, and it is capable of maintaining an earth-pointing accuracy of better than plus or minus 0.1 deg with a motion rate of less than 0.035 deg/s.

It was the latest in the Advanced\nTIROS-N (ATN) series and the design was based on the Defense\nMeteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Launched by the Titan II rocket\nfrom Vandenberg AFB, NOAA-K replaced the decommissioned NOAA 12\nin an afternoon equator-crossing orbit. It provided support to environmental\nmonitoring by complementing the NOAA/NESS geostationary\nmeteorological satellite program (GOES). Instruments were flown for\nimaging and measurement of the Earth's atmosphere, its surface, and cloud\ncover, including Earth radiation, atmospheric ozone, aerosol distribution, sea\nsurface temperature, vertical temperature and water profiles in the\ntroposphere and stratosphere; measurement of proton and electron flux at\norbit altitude, and remote platform data collection, and for SARSAT.

                                        "description": "The world's first operational weather satellite system was placed into\nservice with the launching of the Environmental Satellite Services\nAdministration (which in 1970 became the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration, NOAA) satellites, ESSA-1, on February 3, 1966, and ESSA-2, on\nFebruary 28, 1966.  The objective of this program, called the TIROS Operational\nSystem (TOS), was to acquire global observational data routinely on a daily\nbasis.  This system consisted of a pair of ESSA satellites in sun synchronous\n(polar) orbit.  The odd numbered satellites (ESSA-1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) utilized\nthe Advanced Vidicon Camera System (AVCS) to obtain global imagery which were\ntransmitted to the ESSA Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) stations at Wallops,\nVirginia, and Fairbanks, Alaska.  The CDA stations relayed the data to\nthe National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS), which later became the\nNational Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS),\nlocated in Suitland, Maryland, for processing and distribution to forecasting\ncenters of the U.S. and other nations.  The even numbered satellites (ESSA-2,\n4, 6, and 8) were equipped with Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) TV cameras\nwhich transmitted television pictures directly to ground stations worldwide.\nThe ESSA satellites operated in orbits at altitudes of approximately 1450 km.\n     The second generation operational polar orbiting satellites started with\nthe ITOS-1 (Improved TIROS Operational System) mission launched on January 23,\n1970 which combined the joint capabilities of two ESSA spacecraft; essentially,\nthe direct readout APT system and the global stored images of the AVCS.  The\nsecond generation objectives were to provide improved operational Infrared\n(IR) and Visible (VIS) observations of Earth cloud cover for use in weather\nanalysis and forecasting and also to provide solar proton and global heat data\non a daily basis.  ITOS-1 also carried an operational 2 channel Scanning\nRadiometer (SR) providing day and night radiometric data for immediate\ntransmission as well as acquisition data stored for delayed transmission to CDA\nstations.  With an Infrared 5 channel scanner, global observation of the Earth\natmosphere and surface areas was available once every 12 hours.  A second ITOS\nspacecraft, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite,\nNOAA-1, was launched on December 11, 1970.\n     The ITOS system evolved further with the development of the ITOS-D\nsatellites, NOAA-2, 3, 4, and 5 and were placed into orbit in 1972, 1973, 1974,\nand 1975, respectively.  These had a new sensor complement to provide day and\nnight imaging by means of the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) along with\nthe medium resolution Scanning Radiometer (SR).  The Vertical Temperature\nProfile Radiometer (VTPR) for sounding the atmosphere and the Solar Proton\nMonitor (SPM) for measurements of solar proton and electron flux in the\nvicinity of the satellite were added.\n     The first spacecraft in the third generation operational polar orbiting\nenvironmental satellite system was TIROS-N which was launched in 1978.  The\nthird generation objectives were to provide observations for the atmosphere,\ncloud cover, surface and near-surface.  The TIROS-N type satellites that\nfollowed were NOAA-A (6), NOAA-B which failed to achieve useful orbit, NOAA-C\n(7), and NOAA-D.  The TIROS-N system provided NOAA with the global\nmeteorological and environmental data required for normal operations and for\nthe experimental World Weather Watch (WWW) Program.  The spacecraft had a new\ncomplement of data gathering instruments.  The Advanced Very High Resolution\nRadiometer (AVHRR) provided day and night imaging in the Visible (VIS) and\nInfrared (IR), sea surface temperature (SST) determination, estimation of heat\nbudget components, and identification of snow and sea ice.  The TIROS\nOperational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) supplied improved estimates of the vertical\nstructure of the atmosphere.  The Data Collection System (DCS) gathered\nenvironmental data from fixed and moving platforms such as buoys and\nballoons, and transmitted the data to central stations for processing and\nrelay to users.  The Solar Environment Monitor (SEM) measured solar proton,\nelectron, and alpha particle densities.  The data collected were stored onboard\nthe satellite for transmission to the NOAA central processing facility at\nSuitland, Maryland, through the Wallops and Fairbanks CDA stations.  Satellite\ndata also were transmitted in real time direct readout at VHF and S-band\nfrequencies to remote stations worldwide.\n     The Advanced TIROS-N (ATN) type satellites were NOAA-E (8), NOAA-F (9),\nNOAA-G (10), NOAA-H (11), NOAA-I (12), and NOAA-J (13), the latter two\nscheduled for launch in 1990 and 1991 respectively.  The spacecraft was\nlengthened 0.5m and the solar array was enlarged to provide additional power.\nNew systems were added starting with NOAA-8: the Search and Rescue (SAR)\nsystem; NOAA-9: the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) instruments and\nthe Solar Backscatter UltraViolet (SBUV) radiometer; NOAA-10: ERBE instruments.\nFor more information about the NOAA POES satellite series link to the\n-----------------\nEntry taken from:\nRao, P.K., S.J.

The satellite\ncarried the AVHRR, TOVS, and the solar proton monitor. All of\nwhich were present on previous NOAA satellites.

NOAA-14 was placed in a near\ncircular, (470nm) polar orbit.\n\nNOAA 14 replaced NOAA 11 whose cloud cover imaging instrument\nhad failed a few months before this launch. Besides an imaging\nradiometer, it carries optical sounders to monitor temperature\nand moisture content in the atmosphere, and counters to measure\nenergetic electrons and protons.\n\nA gas leak caused some difficulties in attitude control shortly\nafter launch, but this has been resolved. The motor for the\nMicrowave Sounding Unit on the NOAA 14 spacecraft has stopped\nworking. Records show the unit is from a delivery made to Martin\nMarietta dating back to 1984!

Secondary\nobjectives included providing solar proton and global heat balance\ndata on a regular daily basis.  The nearly cubical spacecraft measured\n1 by 1 by 1.2 m. The TV cameras and infrared sensors were mounted on\nthe satellite baseplate with their optical axes directed vertically\nearthward. The spacecraft was equipped with three curved solar panels\nthat were folded during launch and deployed after orbit was\nachieved. Each panel measured over 4.2 m in length when unfolded and\nwas covered with 3420 solar cells, each measuring 2 by 2 cm. The\nattitude control system maintained desired spacecraft orientation\nthrough gyroscopic principles incorporated into the satellite\ndesign. Earth orientation of the satellite body was maintained by\ntaking advantage of the precession induced from a momentum flywheel so\nthat the satellite body precession rate of one revolution per orbit\nprovided the desired 'earth looking' attitude. Minor adjustments in\nattitude and orientation were made by means of magnetic coils and by\nvarying the speed of the momentum flywheel.\nThis spacecraft carried four cameras; two television cameras for\nAutomatic Picture Transmission (APT), and two Advanced Vidicon Camera\nSystem (AVCS) cameras.  The satellite also carried a low-resolution\nflat plate radiometer, a solar proton monitor, and two scanning\nradiometers that not only measured emitted IR radiation but also\nserved as a backup system for the onboard cameras.  Launched into a\nnear-polar orbit, the spacecraft and its subsystems performed normally\nuntil May 29, 1971 when the incremental tape recorder failed,\nresulting in partial loss of solar proton data and total loss of flat\nplate radiometer data. The APT and Direct Readout Infrared (DRIR)\nsubsystems were turned off on June 20, 1971 in an attempt to reduce\nthe above normal temperature due to overheating in the attitude\ncontrol system. The AVCS was turned off shortly thereafter, and the\nscanning radiometer continued partial operations until the spacecraft\nwas deactivated on August 19, 1971.\nFor more information about NOAA-1:\nhttps://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1970-106A\n__________\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage (SIRS).

SAC-C was developed through the partnership of its senior partners, CONAE and NASA with contributions from Brazil, Denmark, France, and Italy.\n\nSAC-C will provide multispectral imaging of terrestrial and coastal environments. The spacecraft will study the structure and dynamics of the Earth?s atmosphere, ionosphere and geomagnetic field. SAC-C will seek to measure the space radiation in the environment and its influence on advanced electronic components. The satellite will determine the migration route of the Franca whale and verify autonomous methods of attitude and orbit determination.\n\nCONAE is responsible for development of the spacecraft and several instruments. The Brazilian Space Agency provided the testing facilities for SAC-C. The Italian Space Agency has partnered with CONAE to supply both solar panels and two GPS receivers. The Danish Space Research Institute provided the Magnetic Mapping Payload which carries a NASA Supplied Helium Magnetometer, and CNES is contributing an experiment to test the response of electronic circuitry to space radiation. The launch vehicle and some science instruments are provided by NASA. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. is responsible for overall project management.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: SAC-C\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SAC\n      Short_Name: SAC-C\n      Long_Name: Satelite de Aplicaciones Cientifico - C\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MOBLAS\n      Short_Name: MMRS\n      Short_Name: IST\n      Short_Name: INES\n      Short_Name: ICARE\n      Short_Name: HRTC\n      Short_Name: HCS\n      Short_Name: GOLPE\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 702 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.2 degree\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-11-13\n   Online_Resource: http://www.conae.gov.ar/satelites/sac-c.html\n   Sample_Image: http://space.skyrocket.de/img_sat/sac-c__2.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2000-11-21\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: Argentina/CoNAE\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

But help is at hand \u2014 a new generation of Meteosat satellites will soon be launched, delivering Earth observations of unprecedented range, resolution, and frequency.\n\nBuilding on the decades-long legacy of Meteosat\u2019s first and second generation satellites, Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) will revolutionise storm prediction, enhance weather forecasts, extend climate records, and provide a wide range of essential observations.\n\nThese measurements will underpin services, support livelihoods, and help save lives.\n\nNew satellites\n\nMTG is one of the most complex and innovative meteorological geostationary satellite systems ever built. The complete constellation consists of three satellites: two imaging satellites and one sounding satellite, the first operational sounding satellite in a geostationary orbit.\n\nBased on user requirements collected during the planning phase of the programme, MTG will provide near-real-time 3D snapshots of important characteristics of the atmosphere.\n\nMISSION FACTS:\nMTG will orbit the Earth at an altitude of 36,000km keeping a constant view over Europe and Africa.\nMTG constellation consists of three satellites: two imaging satellites (MTG-I), one sounding satellite (MTG-S). Two constellations of six new geostationary satellites will be launched.\nThe Infrared Sounder, Lightning Imager and Ultraviolet Visible Near-infrared (UVN) Spectrometer are world firsts in this orbit.\nMTG lifetime \u2014 MTG-I: 20 years of operational services, MTG-S: 15 years of operational services.\nThe two MTG-I satellites will operate in tandem, one providing 0 degree full disc service, scanning Europe and Africa every 10 minutes, the other providing the rapid scanning service (RSS), scanning Europe every 2.5 minutes.\nMTG-I will deliver more frequent data (full disc every 10 minutes versus 15 minutes currently from MSG and RSS every 2.5 minutes versus 5 minutes), improved spatial resolution (500m/2km versus 1km/3km for MSG) and a better radiometric and spectral resolution (16 channels versus 12 channels for MSG).\nThe Lightning Imager will provide new real-time data on the location and intensity of lightning flashes in its field of view, covering the full Earth disk.\nThe infrared and UVN sounding missions will deliver new capabilities for the real-time monitoring of atmospheric profiles, air quality (e.g. tropospheric ozone and carbon monoxide) and dispersion of atmospheric pollution.\nMTG carries communications payload (GEOSAR) to relay distress signals from 406MHz emergency beacons to rescue services.\nMTG operations will commence following the successful commissioning of the first imaging satellite, MTG-I1 (expected to be one year after launch). The full operational capacity will only be achieved once the first sounder and the second imaging satellite have also been commissioned.\nThe MTG spacecraft are being built by a European consortium led by Thales Alenia Space of France.\nEUMETSAT is responsible for the associated MTG ground segment, which is an integral part of the existing EUMETSAT multi-mission ground network infrastructure, the launch service, the LEOP service and the development of the Satellite Application Facilities part of the MTG programme.",

                                        "description": "The Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats (TROPICS) mission will provide rapid-refresh microwave measurements over the tropics that can be used to observe the thermodynamics of the troposphere and precipitation structure for storm systems at the mesoscale and synoptic scale over the entire storm lifecycle. TROPICS comprises a constellation of CubeSats in three low-Earth orbital planes. Each CubeSat will host a high-performance radiometer scanning across the satellite track at 30 RPM to provide temperature profiles using seven channels near the 118.75 GHz oxygen absorption line, water vapor profiles using 3 channels near the 183 GHz water vapor absorption line, imagery in a single channel near 90 GHz for precipitation measurements, and a single channel at 206 GHz for cloud ice measurements. \n\nThis observing system offers an unprecedented combination of horizontal and temporal resolution to measure environmental and inner-core conditions for tropical cyclones (TCs) on a nearly global scale and is a profound leap forward in the temporal resolution of several key parameters needed for detailed study of high-impact meteorological events (TCs being the primary emphasis in this proposal). TROPICS will demonstrate that a constellation approach to earth Science can provide improved resolution, configurable coverage (tropics, near global, or global), flexibility, reliability, and launch access at extremely low cost, thereby serving as a model for future missions.",

                                "description": "TiungSat-1 is Malaysia's first national microsatellite. It was designed and developed in a collaborative effort between the Malaysian government, under the government appointed company ATSB \\[Astronautic Technology (Malaysia) Sdn. Bdh.\\] of Kuala Lumpur, and SSTL (Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.) of Surrey, UK. In the view of the Malaysian government, the satellite development program was seen as an impetus for expanding Malaysia's capability in the area of high-technology industry. The first satellite was named \"Tiung\" after a beautiful small singing bird in Malaysia. Astronautic Technology Sdn. Bhd. (ATSB) is a research and development organization, which was formed in 1995 by the government of Malaysia. \n\nThe TiungSat-1 specific applications are in the following fields:\n\n* Collection of imagery for environmental and meteorological use\n* Digital S&F (Store & Forward) communications\n* Technology demonstration\n* Space science\n* Amateur radio access\n\nSpacecraft:\n\nThe TiungSat-1 S/C structure comprises eleven module trays used to house the electronics for the bus and payload systems. The box-like spacecraft has a size of 690 mm x 360 mm x 360 mm; it is three-axis stabilized using a gravity-gradient boom (6 m boom with tip mass), two 3-axis magnetorquers, and a momentum wheel. Attitude is sensed by two 3-axis magnetometers and by two-axis analog sun sensors. In addition, there are UED (Underneath Earth Detector) and SOD (Sun Overhead Detector). The pointing knowledge is in roll and pitch and in yaw (3 sigma values). The S/C power is 35 W per panel, provided by four surface-mounted GaAs solar panels and by a 10-cell NiCd battery (7 Ah). The power subsystem provides regulated voltage supplies at +5V and 10V along with an unregulated supply which fluctuates between 12-14 V. Autonomous functions, safe modes and data are handled by two OBCs (On-Board Computer), OBC-186 and OBC-386. Onboard data handling via a CAN (Controller Area Network) between platform and payloads. The onboard data storage capacity is 1 Gbit. The S/C mass is 50 kg (platform = 35 kg, payload = 15 kg). The nominal design life is three years.\n\nRF communications: TiungSat uses conventional AMSAT frequencies (Malaysian Oscar-46), thereby giving amateur radio operators access to its data (imagery and communication capabilities). The microsatellite features an AX.25 protocol store-and-forward PACSAT protocol suite communications system. The uplink is in VHF-band with a data rate of 9.6 kbit/s; three receivers are used: Rx1 operates at 144.46 MHz, Rx2 and Rx3 operate at 145.86 145.925 MHz, selectable. The downlink is dual-redundant in UHF-band (435 to 438 MHz range with 437.300, 437.325, 437.350, 437.375 MHz, selectable) with data rates of 9.6, and 38.4 kbit/s (experimentally at 76.8 kit/s). An error-protected digital packet communications protocol is used. All spacecraft operations are performed at ATSB in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nTiungSat-1 was launched Sept. 26, 2000 on a Dnepr-1 vehicle along with other satellites (the other payloads were: SaudiSat-1A/-1B of SISR (Saudi Institute for Space Research), UniSat of the University of Rome, and MegSat-1 of the MegSat Space Division of \"Gruppo Meggiorin,\" Bresia, Italy) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan.\n\nOrbit: Circular orbit, altitude = 650 km, inclination = 64, period = 97 minutes.\n\nSpacecraft operations are carried out at ATSB's Mission Control Station located at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor. The satellite has also been used in a number of educational activities ranging from the physical sciences to the humanities.\n\nOperational status of TiungSat-1 as of 2004: The payload was fully operational well beyond its design life of three years. However, since Jan. 2004, the payload is only being operated intermittently to reduce the power consumption of the battery.\n\nSensor/experiment complement (MSEIS, MEIS, S&F, CEDEX):\n\nMSEIS (Multi-Spectral Earth Imaging System). MSEIS is a NAC (Narrow Angle Camera), a multispectral system of three cameras (green, red and near-infrared) in parallel, each with a 75 mm focal length optic and 100 mm aperture diameter. The NAC system provides a 78 m ground spatial resolution in three spectral bands: 510-590 nm, 610-690 nm and 810-890 nm (green, red, and near infrared). A two-dimensional CCD staring array detector with 1024 x 1024 pixels is used providing snapshot imagery of scene size 78 km x 78 km. Up to four contiguous images can be collected along the flight path. The data are digitized to 8 bits radiometric resolution (256 levels).\n\nMEIS (Metrological Earth Imaging System). MEIS is a single-band WAC (Wide Angle Camera) system with 6.5 mm focal length optics. It provides NIR imagery (810-890 nm) with a 900 m spatial resolution. The CCD area array detector has a size of 1024 x 1024 elements (pixels) for snapshot observations. Data are quantized to 8 bits radiometric resolution. An image has the size of 900 km x 900 km. The data is being used for meteorological applications.\n\nS&F (Digital Store & Forward Communications). The subsystem provides global, frequency-agile, communications for any form of digitized data: e-mail, voice-mail, scientific data exchange, fax, imagery, or even Internet mail for remote regions. The low cost and direct access offered by the TiungSat-1 microsatellite in orbit also makes it ideal for use by scientists, engineers and students based in institutes, universities and even schools throughout the world. - DSPE (Digital Signal Processing Experiment). The DSPE consists of a TM320C31 low power DSP suitable for special or general purpose signal processing tasks on LEO satellites. The VHF scanner operates in the 140-150 MHz range. A built-in FSK decoder is used. The system is capable to detect signals from a pre-set signal strength threshold within selected bar. DSP can be used for processing audio transmission for rebroadcast.\n\nCEDEX (Cosmic Ray Energy Deposition Experiment). The objective of CEDEX is to characterize the TiungSat-1 orbit radiation environment in terms of the observed particle LET (Linear Energy Transfer) spectrum at the spacecraft. The primary sensor consists of a 30mm x 30mm PIN diode detector 300 microns in depth, housed in a separate screened aluminium unit mounted on the CEDEX module box (three area PIN-diode detectors are mounted in a \"telescopic\" arrangement; hence, information pertaining to directions of the energy particles detected can be derived.). This is connected to a charge amplifier and a pulse-shaping circuit which, in turn, are connected to an event-driven, hardware-logic controlled pulse-height multi-channel analyzer. CEDEX is controlled autonomously by a CAN-microcontroller with its own data-storage RAM and built-in data-compression software. This sends data to an internal CAN-controller which formats and sends them on to the primary OBC via the spacecraft's CAN (Controlled Area Network) bus. CEDEX is a multichannel analyzer with 512 channels and a 0.5 pC (picocoulomb) charge resolution. The instrument charge range is between 0.2 -24 pC, equivalent to a normal incidence particle LET range of about 60 - 7500 MeV cm2 g-1 (200,000 particles/s).\n\nThe CEDEX data obtained are comparable directly with such instruments as CREDO-II flown on STRV-1c (launch Nov. 16, 2000) and CRE (Cosmic Ray Experiment) flown on KitSat-1 (launch Aug. 10, 1992) and PoSat-1 (launch Sept. 26, 1993).\n\nExperimental Microsatellite GPS, an SSTL/ESA collaboration. An advanced 12-channel GPS receiver with two GPS patch antennas is installed for several objectives: 1) onboard generation of Keplerian orbital elements (NORAD experiment, this was first performed on PoSat), 2) onboard navigation, attitude, and timing services, and 3) refractive sounding of the ionosphere. The instrument is primarily used for orbit and position determination and for precise onboard timing services. In parallel, the instrument is also employed for refractive ionospheric monitoring. The TEC (Total Electron Content) occultation observations of the instrument provide slant range measurements which can be converted into vertical profiles. \n\nInformation provided by:  http://www.eoPortal.org\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: TIUNGSAT-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: TIUNGSAT-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: MySat-1\n      Short_Name: Oscar-46\n      Short_Name: MO-46\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CCD IMAGER\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 650\n      Orbit_Inclination: 64.6\n      Period: 97.1\n      Perigee: 605.3\n      Apogee: 647\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-19\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=7470\n   Online_Resource: http://www.sstl.co.uk/\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2000-09-26\n      Launch_Site: Baikonur Cosmodrome, Tyuratam, Russia\n      Primary_Sponsor: Malaysia\n      Primary_Sponsor: Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.

OrbView-3 collected one meter panchromatic (black and white) or four meter multispectral (color) imagery at a swath width of 8 km for both sensors. One meter imagery enables more accurate viewing and mapping of houses, automobiles and aircraft, and makes it possible to create precise digital products. Four meter multispectral imagery provides color and near infrared (NIR) information to further characterize cities, rural areas and undeveloped land from space.  Imagery from the OrbView-3 satellite complements existing geographic information system (GIS) data for commercial, environmental and national security customers. OrbView-3 orbits 470 km above the Earth in a sun-synchronous polar orbit while collecting imagery of the Earth's surface at one meter resolution in the Panchromatic (black and white) mode, or at four meter resolution in the Multispectral (color) mode with a three day repeat cycle.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center received 179,981 OrbView-3 image \u201csegments\u201d from GeoEye with no restrictions. The data were delivered in Basic Enhanced (Level 1B) radiometrically corrected format. The product files include satellite telemetry data, rational functions, post-processed Ground Sample Distance (GPS) at nadir data, and sufficient metadata for rigorous triangulation.\n\nThe data in this collection were acquired between September 2003 and March 2007, from the multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (Pan) sensors.  Over 84% of the Orbview-3 collection is PAN (black & white).",

Use\nof a stabilization and control system permitted the spacecraft's orientation to\nbe controlled to within plus or minus 1 degree for all three axes (pitch, roll,\nand yaw).\nThe spacecraft carried an advanced vidicon camera system for recording and\nstoring remote cloudcover pictures, an automatic picture transmission camera\nfor providing real-time cloudcover pictures, and both high- and\nmedium-resolution infrared radiometers (HRIR and MRIR) for measuring the\nintensity and distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by and\nreflected from the earth and its atmosphere. The spacecraft and experiments\nperformed normally after launch until July 26, 1966, when the spacecraft tape\nrecorder failed. Its function was taken over by the HRIR tape recorder until\nNovember 15, 1966, when it also failed. Some real-time data were collected\nuntil January 17, 1969, when the spacecraft mission was terminated owing to\ndeterioration of the horizon scanner used for earth reference.\n__________\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage (SIRS).

                                        "description": "Nimbus-1 was launched in August 1964 and was the first in a series of\nsecond-generation meteorological research-and-development satellites that was\ndesigned to serve as a stabilized, earth-oriented platform for the testing of\nadvanced meteorological sensor systems and for collecting meteorological data.\nThe polar-orbiting spacecraft consisted of three major elements: (1) a sensory\nring, (2) solar paddles, and (3) the control system housing. The solar paddles\nand the control system housing were connected to the sensory ring by a truss\nstructure, giving the satellite the appearance of an ocean buoy. Nimbus-1 was\nnearly 3.7 m tall, 1.5 m in diameter at the base, and about 3 m across with\nsolar paddles extended. The sensory ring, which formed the satellite base,\nhoused the electronics equipment and battery modules. The lower surface of the\ntorus-shaped sensory ring provided mounting space for sensors and telemetry\nantennas. An H-frame structure mounted within the center of the torus provided\nsupport for the larger experiments and tape recorders. Mounted on the control\nsystem housing, which was located on top of the spacecraft, were sun sensors,\nhorizon scanners, gas nozzles for attitude control, and a command antenna. Use\nof a stabilization and control system allowed the spacecraft's orientation to\nbe controlled to within plus or minus 1 degree for all three axes (pitch, roll,\nand yaw).\nThe spacecraft carried an advanced vidicon camera system for recording and\nstoring remote cloudcover pictures, an automatic picture transmission camera\nfor providing real-time cloudcover pictures, and a high-resolution infrared\nradiometer to complement the daytime TV coverage and to measure nighttime\nradiative temperatures of cloud tops and surface terrain. A short second-stage\nburn resulted in an unplanned eccentric orbit. Otherwise, the spacecraft and\nits experiments operated successfully until September 22, 1964.  The solar\npaddles became locked in position, resulting in inadequate electrical power to\ncontinue operations.\n__________\nTaken from the NSSDC System for Information Retrieval and Storage (SIRS).

                                "description": "Tsinghua-1 is a microsatellite of Tsinghua University, developed and built in a joint venture between SSTL of Guildford, Surrey, UK, and Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. The TSRC (Tsinghua Space Research Center) was set up in Oct. 1998 with the goal to integrate all space research activities at Tsinghua University and to provide a means and facilities for S/C building. The joint-venture company in Beijing is referred to as T-SSSC (Tsinghua-Surrey Small Satellite Company). The cooperative program is to develop and build microsatellites (Tsinghua-1) and nanosatellites (THNS-1) and to provide integrated training in small satellite design.\n\nTsinghua-1 (also referred to as \"Hangtian\" in Chinese) is a demonstrator microsatellite in the 50 kg class of size: 35 cm x 35 cm x 64 cm. The overall objective is to provide daily high-resolution imaging for disaster monitoring and mitigation on a worldwide scale. A further goal of Tsinghua-1 is to conduct communications research in LEO. The design uses the new MicroSat-70 platform modules or trays to carry the subsystems and payload. The power subsystem design includes the regulation, protection and distribution of a 35 W solar array and 7 Ah NiCd batteries. This subsystem essentially offers two buses: an unregulated 14 V bus and a regulated 5 V bus. The three payload modules include the GPS receiver (SGR-10 with 12 channels), transputer, and DSP/DTE (Digital Signal Processing/Data Transfer Experiment) unit. The three cameras and 3 reaction wheels are accommodated in the Earth Observation Compartment. Two GPS antennas are accommodated on the space facing side of the S/C.\n\nThe spacecraft is three-axis stabilized using a combination of passive (gravity-gradient boom) and active (magnetorquers, reaction wheels) actuator elements. The platform is nadir pointing. Attitude is sensed by sun sensors and a magnetometer. The body-pointing platform has the capability to perform fast slew maneuvers within 15 about the roll axis (or 180 about the yaw axis). An off-nadir pointing configuration can be sustained for up to half an orbit. Onboard data handling is provided with a dual CAN (Controller Area Network) bus (ISO 11898 & ISO 11519-1) 20 Mbit/s, and INMOS serial point-to-point link 9.6 kbit/s asynchronous duplex UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter).\n\nA launch of Tsinghua-1, along with SNAP-1 of SSTL as secondary payloads to Nadezhda-6, the prime Russian S&RSAT (Search & Rescue Satellite) of COSPAS, took place on June 28, 2000 on a Russian Cosmos-3M launcher from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia.\n\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, altitude = 700 km, inclination = 98, period of 100 minutes.\n\nStatus of Tsinghua-1 mission: The spacecraft is operational as of 2004. \n\nSensor complement:\n\nMEIS (Multispectral Earth Imaging System).MEIS is a demonstrator instrument intended for the upcoming DMC (Disaster Monitoring Constellation) mission. The objective is to acquire multispectral Earth surface imagery with a spatial resolution of 40 m (snapshot imagery). The MEIS camera assembly consists of three cameras (one for each spectral band) mounted at an angle of 15 from nadir so that the yaw angle can be selected to offer the required off-pointing angle of 15 from nadir. The image swath width is 80 km and each camera can collect four images contiguously along the flight path. The instrument performs autonomous onboard histogram analysis to ensure optimum image quality involving image processing, compression and onboard storage. The OBCs may also be used to carry out autonomous onboard cloud editing and high-compression thumb-nail image previews.\n\nSGR-10 (Space GPS Receiver-10). The objective is real-time positioning for tracking the satellite and providing orbital elements for the spacecraft mission and ground station. SGR is a customized COTS-developed receiver. The instrument is based on the second generation GPS chip set of MITEL Semiconductors. The SGR consists of the following elements: GPS antennas, LNAs, the RF section, the digital section and the TLM/TC node. \n\nRF section: The SGR has two separate RF front-ends in the RF section which are responsible for down-converting the GPS signals and digitizing the IF signals. The RF sections use the same local oscillator so that the measurements are referenced to the same fundamental TCXO clock.\n\nDigital section: This part consists of hardware correlator channels, memory, a 32 bit RISC microprocessor with supporting peripherals and the interface circuitry. There are 24 C/A code correlation channels available, although only 12 channels are available if only 2 antennas are used.\n\nTLM/TC node: A separate 8 bit microcontroller is used to provide telemetry and telecommands. The telemetry includes status monitoring of SGR, while telecommand include reset, power down parts of the receiver, some redundancy switching etc.\n\nThe SGR-10 receives the L1 signal from the GPS constellation. The total SGR mass is 1.355 kg, including antenna/LNA. The accuracy of positioning, velocity and time synchronization (under Selective Availability on GPS) are: 150 m, 1 m/s, 3-D, 2 sigma approximately, and + 1 s, respectively. \n\nInformation from http://www.eoPortal.org\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: TSINGHUA-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: TSINGHUA-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 700\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98.14\n      Period: 98.68\n      Perigee: 687\n      Apogee: 713\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-19\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=9264\n   Online_Resource: http://www.sstl.co.uk/\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2000-06-28\n      Launch_Site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia\n      Primary_Sponsor: Tsinghua University (China)\n      Primary_Sponsor: Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.

As the most advanced gravity space mission to date, GOCE will realise a broad range of fascinating new possibilities for oceanography, solid Earth physics, geodesy and sea-level research, and significantly contribute to furthering our understanding of climate change.  \n \nAlthough invisible, gravity is a complex force of nature that has an immeasurable impact on our everyday lives. It is often assumed that the force of gravity on the surface of the Earth has a constant value, but in fact the value of 'g' varies subtly from place to place. These variations are due to a number of factors such as the rotation of the Earth, the position of mountains and ocean trenches and variations in density of the Earth's interior.\n\nOver its life of about 20 months, GOCE will map these global variations in the gravity field with extreme detail and accuracy. This will result in a unique model of the 'geoid', which is the surface of equal gravitational potential defined by the gravity field \u2013 crucial for deriving accurate measurements of ocean circulation and sea-level change, both of which are affected by climate change. GOCE-derived data are also much needed to understand more about processes occurring inside the Earth and for use in practical applications such as surveying and levelling.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GOCE\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: Earth Explorers\n      Short_Name: GOCE\n      Long_Name: Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: LRR\n      Short_Name: EGG\n      Short_Name: SSTI\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 250 km (Hibernation 270 km)\n      Orbit_Inclination: 96.7\u00b0\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2009-05-15\n   Online_Resource: http://www.esa.int/esaLP/LPgoce.html\n   Online_Resource: http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/list_of_satellites/goce_general.html\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2009-03-17\n      Launch_Site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia\n      Design_Life: 20 months\n      Primary_Sponsor: ESA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

                                        "description": "IMS-1, previously referred to as TWSat (Third World Satellite), is a low-cost microsatellite imaging mission of ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization). The overall objective is to provide medium-resolution imagery for developing countries for free. Around 50 data reception terminals will be installed by ISRO in selected Third World countries and also at some universities in India.\n\nhe project started in 2005 with a definition phase of the mission. The ISRO approach was to develop two versions of a standard small spacecraft bus (SSB) design with the objective to provide a low-cost and a quick-response time approach to space.\n\n\u2022 A microsatellite version (first use by the IMS-1 mission)\n\n\u2022 A minisatellite version (first use by the SARAL mission)\n\nThe main advantage of these \"smallsats\" is the fact that they can be launched by a PSLV vehicle as a piggyback payload on any one of the larger primary payloads (like IRS satellites).\n\nThe modular design concept of the SSB is suited for series production making the bus a natural choice for constellation-flight applications. The design layout is such that the bus module and the payload module of each series may be integrated and tested separately (thus reducing the interdependency during the realization between both modules). Each SSB version is 3-axis stabilized. SSB is also designed to accommodate different types of payloads with minor modification from mission to mission. \n\nThe SSB micro-bus uses aluminum honeycomb panels arranged in a cuboid structure with internal shear frames. This design is made to provide maximum area for mounting the packages while being sturdy. All the subsystem packages are mounted within the cuboid except sensors and antennas which are mounted outside. The structure includes a launch vehicle interface and solar panel interfaces. The payloads are mounted on the top deck, with optical axis towards the + yaw direction.\n\nThe power subsystem consists of solar panels, battery, power conditioning and distribution units. There are two solar panels of size 0.81m x 0.72 m in the roll direction of the satellite. The panels are stowed during the launch and deployed after injection to the orbit. The satellite is nominally in sun-pointing mode with the solar panels facing the sun. For every payload operation, the satellite is maneuvered into an Earth-pointing mode and goes back to the sun-pointing mode after the imaging operation. Multi-junction solar cells are being used to provide higher efficiency of power conversion to generate about 230 W. A Li-ion battery is used with a capacity of 10.5 Ah, having a mass of about 3.5 kg. The power subsystem provides a single raw bus of 28 to 33 V. There are four DC/DC converters which provide the required secondary voltages for the payloads and bus subsystems.\n\nThe AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem) uses sun sensors with 4\u03c0 FOV providing an accuracy of 0.5\u00ba in all axes. The sun sensors are being used for sun acquisition and safe mode detection and recovery. A MEMS-based magnetometer is being used in the spacecraft de-tumbling support mode and in the momentum dumping of the reaction wheels. A star sensor, providing an inertial quaternion output, is used as prime sensor during 3-axis stabilization and during the maneuver support modes. The accuracy of the star sensor is < 40 arcsec in all axes. In addition, there are two miniaturized gyros which are dynamically tuned. A GPS-based SPS (Satellite Positioning System) is used to provide the satellite position to an accuracy of < 30 m. Actuation is provided by magnetic torquers (momentum dumping), micro reaction wheels,and an RCS (Reaction Control Subsystem). The reaction wheels have aan angular momentum capacity of 0.36 Nms and a torque of 0.015 Nm. The wheels are arranged in a tetrahedral configuration to provide enhanced torques about any axis. The RCS consists of a single tank (8 liter volume) containing a monopropellant fuel and a single 1N thruster. The thruster is primarily used for orbit corrections.\n\nBMU (Bus Management Unit): The BMU represents the heart of the satellite providing the functions of telecommand decoding, house keeping telemetry, data encoding, sensor processing, on/off control of the subsystems and heaters, command distribution, spacecraft control during initial acquisition, normal mode, safe mode etc., using the actuators. This subsystem is realized in a single PCB (Printed Circuit Board).\n\nPassive control methods (with elements like multi layer insulation blankets, optical surface reflectors, thermal paints and heaters wherever necessary.) are being used in the thermal control subsystem. \n\nLaunch: A launch of IMS-1 as a secondary payload on a PSLV vehicle (PSLV-C9) took place on April 28, 2008 from the SDSC-SHAR launch site (Sriharikota, India) of ISRO. The primary payload on this flight was CartoSat-2A (launch mass of 690 kg), an Indian military high-resolution panchromatic imaging satellite (based on CartoSat-2 of ISRO).\n\nTWSat carries two payloads: the Mx-T (Multispectral Camera) and the HySI (Hyperspectral Imager). However, since the data of both imagers is rather high, only one of them will be powered on and data transmitted at any given time.\n\nMx-T (Multispectral Camera). The instrument of modular design provides four spectral bands in VNIR, where each band employs an individual lens, a separate CCD detector, and separate front-end electronics. The camera operates in a pushbroom scanning mode to image the Earth. The spatial resolution at nadir is 36 m on a swath of 151 km. The 12 bit video output is coded to 10 bit with multi-linear gain. Mx-T has a mass of 5.5 kg and a power consumption of 18 W.\n\nAll the front end electronics and the video processors are accommodated on the electro optical module (EOM) itself. Each band has one detector which gives out data in 4 ports with 10 bits per pixel. The source data (32 Mbit/s) is sent to the baseband data handling system of the microsatellite bus, compressed and stored in SSR (Solid State Recorder). The recorded data is transmitted to the ground in S-band at 8 Mbit/s. \n\nHySI-T (Hyperspectral Imager). The prototype instrument providing a total of 64 spectral bands in the VNIR region. Spectral separation is realized using the wedge filter technique. Detection is provided with a CMOS/APS (Active Pixel Sensor) area device. - The HySI-T data may be used for resource characterization and detailed studies. The HySI-T is being used on an experimental basis to obtain experience of such a payload and also of handling the hyperspectral data and generating the application models.\n\nMission operations: While Mx-T serves the basic requirement of the imaging mission, the HySI-T is incorporated on an experimental basis. It is planned to operate the Mx-T instrument on for most of the orbits based on the user demands, while the HySI-T is operated over Indian ground stations for evaluation purposes. Either of the payloads will be operated at a time in order to conserve the available resources on board the microsatellite.\n\nThe data from the two payloads is being downlinked separately. The Mx-T data is compressed at a ratio of 3.4:1, formatted, RS (Reed Solomon) encoded and stored on SSR (Solid Sate Recorder). The downlink is in near real-time via the S-band transmitter. The SSR has the storage capacity of 16 Gbit providing a maximum storage volume of 20 minutes data in segmented form. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: IMS-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Earth Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: IMS-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MX-T\n      Short_Name: CCD IMAGER\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 635 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 98 km\n      Period: 97.3 minutes\n      Perigee: 626.5 km\n      Apogee: 646.3 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-06-27\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=15158\n   Sample_Image: http://directory.eoportal.org/presentations/6100/IMS1_Auto9.jpeg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2008-04-28\n      Launch_Site: Sriharikota Island, India\n      Primary_Sponsor: Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

NASA's space shuttle fleet began setting records with its first launch on April 12, 1981 and continued to set high marks of achievement and endurance through 30 years of missions. Starting with Columbia and continuing with Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour, the spacecraft has carried people into orbit repeatedly, launched, recovered and repaired satellites, conducted cutting-edge research and built the largest structure in space, the International Space Station. The final space shuttle mission, STS-135, ended July 21, 2011 when Atlantis rolled to a stop at its home port, NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nAs humanity's first reusable spacecraft, the space shuttle pushed the bounds of discovery ever farther, requiring not only advanced technologies but the tremendous effort of a vast workforce. Thousands of civil servants and contractors throughout NASA's field centers and across the nation have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to mission success and the greater goal of space exploration.",

The USMP flights are\nregularly scheduled on Shuttle missions to permit scientists\naccess to space for microgravity and fundamental science\nexperiments which cannot be duplicated on Earth and provide the\nfoundation for advanced scientific investigations that will be\ndone on the international space station.\n\nThe Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (OAST-2) payload\ncontains six experiments that will obtain technology data to\nsupport future needs for advanced satellites, sensors,\nmicrocircuits and the space station. Data gathered by the OAST-2\nexperiments could lead to satellites and spacecraft that are\ncheaper, more reliable and able to operate more efficiently.\n\nSTS-62 will help scientists calibrate sensitive ozone- detecting\ninstruments with the sixth flight of the Shuttle Solar\nBackscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) Instrument. This highly\ncalibrated tool is used to check data from ozone-measuring\ninstruments on free-flying satellites -- NASA's Total Ozone\nMapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Upper Atmosphere Research\nSatellite (UARS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration NOAA-9 and NOAA-11 satellites.\n\nThe Protein Crystal Growth (PCG) experiments and the Commercial\nProtein Crystal Growth (CPCG) experiments aboard Columbia will\nhelp scientists understand the growth of crystals to study the\ncomplex molecular structures of important proteins. By knowing\nthe structure of specific proteins, scientists can design new\ndrug treatments for humans and animals and develop new or better\nfood crops.\n\nNASA's efforts in the important field of biotechnology are\nrepresented by the fourth flight of the Physiological Systems\nExperiment which is designed to evaluate pharmaceutical,\nagricultural or biotechnological products, and the first flight\nof the Biotechnology Specimen Temperature Controller (BSTC),\ndesigned to test the performance of a temperature control device\nbeing developed for use with the Bioreactor, a cell- culture\ngrowth device. Also flying again on the Shuttle is the\nCommercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) payload which\nwill support more than 15 commercial life science investigations\nthat have application in biomaterials, biotechnology, medicine\nand agriculture.\n\nThe Middeck 0-Gravity Dynamics Experiment (MODE) will make its\nsecond flight on STS-62. MODE investigates how the microgravity\nof space flight influences the behavior of large space\nstructures. The MODE test article can be configured in different\nshapes typical of space structural forms-- the truss of a space\nstation, for example -- to help engineers develop and verify an\nanalytical modeling capability for predicting the linear and\nnonlinear modal characteristics of space structures in a\nmicrogravity environment. MODE also will gather force\nmeasurements of nominal, crew-induced disturbance loads on the\nShuttle.\n\nAstronauts will demonstrate a new magnetic end effector and\ngrapple fixture design for the Shuttle's Canadian-built robot\narm that engineers believe will increase the arm's dexterity and\nalignment accuracy, provide operators with a sense of touch and\nallow the use of more compact \"handles\" on satellites and other\nShuttle payloads.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-62/mission-sts-62.html\"\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]",

                                        "description": "The Space Radar Laboratory - 1  (SRL-1) was launched onboard the Space Shuttle \"Endeavor\" (STS-59) on April 9, 1994.  The SRL-1 consists of two elements: a suite of radar instruments called the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) jointly developed by NASA and DARA of Germany and ASI of Italy, and the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS) instrument to measure atmospheric air pollution. SRL-1 is the first in a series of flights of this payload designed to (1) acquire radar imagery of the Earth's surface for studies in geology, geography, hydrology, oceanography, agronomy, and botany; (2) gather data for future space-borne radar systems;  and (3) provide measurements of the global distribution of carbon monoxide (CO) in the troposphere. Instruments on board include the Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) with multi-frequency (C- and  L-Bands), multi-polarization (HH, VV, HV, VH), and multi-incidence angle (15 to 55  degrees) capabilities thus lending itself to a wide range of earth surface applications; the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR), an X-band, VV-polarized imaging radar system, built by Dornier (Germany) and Alenia (Italy) for the German Space Agency (DARA)/German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI); and, the Mapping Air Pollution from Space (MAPS) instrument for the study of global air pollution. The MAPS instrument, from NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MtPE) Program.  Four 45-Mbps data channels were recorded on special high data rate tape recorders and real-time data was transmitted to ground stations. About 50 hours each of SIR-C and X-SAR data were recorded during the mission. The combined SIR-C/X-SAR Science Team was made up of 49 members and 3 associates representing 13 countries. SIR-C/X-SAR data collection was focused on several worldwide supersites and correlated with ground and aircraft measurements. Radar data was also calibrated to allow comparisons with other operating spaceborne radars (ERS-1 SAR, JERS-1 SAR).\n\nBoth SIR-C and X-SAR will use on-board tape recorders to store data as well as limited real-time transmissions to the ground. Each radar has its own on-board data handling system and each radar can have its data routed through the TDRSS for real-time transmission (Ku-band). SIR-C data are recorded in parallel and X-SAR data is recorded serially. SIR-C and X-SAR data will be preprocessed at the Payload Operations Control Center (POCC) at NASA/JSC before delivery to JPL and operations centers in Germany and Italy. Commands are sent to the SRL-1 from POCC. At mission end, data tapes recorded on-board are sent to the PI sites.\n\nThe SIR-C/X-SAR part of the SRL-1 mission is expected to collect over 50 hours of data, both recorded and real-time. Real-time raw data will be pre-processed by the instrument PIs and science teams and stored at the PI sites at JPL, in Germany, and in Italy for analysis. SIR-C data will be processed at JPL using the JPL advanced digital SAR processor, leading to processed SAR images on 8-mm digital tape and on film. Plans include the production of CD-ROMs with 100 m resolution images. X-SAR data will be pre-processed within 3 months. Image products will be made available to X-SAR investigators. Both Germany and Italy will operate separate archives and processing facilities for X-SAR data. SIR-C processed data will eventually be be archived with the EOSDIS DAAC at EROS Data Center. All processed MAPS data is expected to be archived with the EOSDIS DAAC at NASA/Langley. Two additional flights of SRL are planned (August 1994 and 1995).\n\nSome SIR-C and X-SAR images are publically available on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) FTP site: jplinfo.jpl.nasa.gov in the directory /sircxsar. The images are also available through the World Wide Web (WWW) at http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/.

Spacelab 1 consisted of a pressurized compartment (module) for housing equipment and flight personnel and a space-exposed platform to accommodate instruments.  The compartment and platform were flown into space and returned inside the payload compartment of the Space Shuttle.  The mission lasted 10 days, and while in space, the Shuttle payload compartment doors were opened to allow viewing of the earth, sun, and deep space.  Spacelab 1 was a multidiscipline mission comprising five broad areas of investigation: Atmospheric Physics and Earth Observations, Space Plasma Physics, Astronomy and Solar Physics, Material Sciences and Technology, and Life Sciences.  The Atmospheric Physics investigations conducted studies of the earth's environment through surveys of temperature, composition, and motion of the atmosphere.  The Earth Observations investigations used and evaluated the capability of advanced measuring systems for making topographic and thematic maps from high-resolution photographs and from remote-sensing data.  Investigations in the Space Plasma Physics group studied the charged particle or plasma environment of the earth.  The Astronomy investigations studied astronomical sources of radiation in the ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths.  The Solar Physics investigations measured the total energy output of the sun using three different methods with the instruments cross calibrated so that meaningful comparisons could be made.  The Material Sciences and Technology investigations took advantage of the microgravity conditions to perform studies in such areas as crystal growth, metallurgy, tribology, fluid physics, and ceramics technology.  The Life Sciences investigations were concerned with the effects of the space environment (zero gravity and high-energy radiation) on human physiology and on the growth, development, and organization of biological systems.  The mission was considered very successful.",

                                        "description": "During the 10 day mission, the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) payload in Endeavour's cargo bay will make its second flight. The SRL payload, which first flew during STS-59 in April 1994, will again give scientists highly detailed information that will help them distinguish between human-induced environmental changes and other natural forms of change.\n\nSRL-2 will take radar images of the Earth's surface for Earth system sciences studies, including geology, geography, hydrology, oceanography, agronomy and botany.\n\nThe SRL payload is comprised of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR), and the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS). The German Space Agency (DARA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) are providing the X-SAR instrument.\n\nThe imaging radar of the SIR-C/X-SAR instruments has the ability to make measurements over virtually any region at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions. The radar waves can penetrate clouds, and under certain conditions, also can \"see\" through vegetation, ice and extremely dry sand. In many cases, radar is the only way scientists can explore inaccessible regions of the Earth's surface. \n\nThe SIR-C/X-SAR radar data provide information about how many of Earth's complex systems - those processes that control the movement of land, water, air and life - work together to make this a livable planet. The science team particularly wants to study the amount of vegetation coverage, the extent of snow packs, wetlands areas, geologic features such as rock types and their distribution, volcanic activity, ocean wave heights and wind speed. STS-68 will fly over the same sites that STS-59 observed so that scientists will be able to study seasonal changes that may have occurred in those areas between the missions.\n\nAn international team of 49 science investigators and three associates will conduct the SIR-C/X-SAR experiments. Thirteen nations are represented: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the United States.\n\nThe MAPS experiment will measure the global distribution of carbon monoxide in the troposphere, or lower atmosphere. Measurements of carbon monoxide, an important element in several chemical cycles, provide scientists with indications of how well the atmosphere can cleanse itself of \"greenhouse gases,\" chemicals that can increase the atmosphere's temperature.\n\nSTS-68 provided a continuation of NASA's Get Away Special (GAS) experiments program. The project gives a person or organization a chance to perform experiments in space on a Shuttle mission. Two universities, North Carolina A&T State University and University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the Swedish Space Corp., Soina, Sweden, will have small self-contained payloads flying during the STS-68 mission. Other GAS hardware in Endeavour's payload bay will carry 500,000 commemorative stamps for the U.S. Postal Service in recognition of the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.\n\nOther payloads aboard Endeavour include the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) which will fly for the first time, and the Military Applications of Ship Tracks (MAST) which will be making its second flight. BRIC experiments, sponsored by NASA's Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications, are designed to examine the effects of microgravity on a wide range of physiological processes in higher order plants and arthropod animals (e.g., insects, spiders, centipedes, crustaceans). MAST is an experiment sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and is part of a five-year research program developed by ONR to examine the effects of ships on the marine environment.\n\nThe Commercial Protein Crystal Growth (CPCG) experiment, the Chromosome and Plant Cell Division in Space Experiment (CHROMEX) and the Cosmic Radiation Effects and Activation Monitor (CREAM) experiment also will be carried aboard Endeavour.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: SRL-2\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SPACE SHUTTLE\n      Short_Name: SRL-2\n      Long_Name: Space Radar Laboratory-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: SRL-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: X-SAR\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-28\n   Online_Resource: http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/backup%2010-5/sts-68/\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1994-09-30\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The spaceship Atlantis has carried on the spirit  of the sailing vessel with several important voyages of its own,  including the Galileo planetary explorer mission in 1989 and the  deployment of the Arthur Holley Compton Gamma Ray Observatory in  1991.\n\nAtlantis benefited from lessons learned in the construction and  testing of Enterprise, Columbia and Challenger. At rollout, its  weight was some 6,974 pounds less than Columbia. The Experience  gained during the Orbiter assembly process also enabled  Atlantis to be completed with a 49.5 percent reduction in man  hours (compared to Columbia). Much of this decrease can be  attributed to the greater use of thermal protection blankets on  the upper orbiter body instead of tiles. During the  construction of Discovery and Atlantis, NASA opted to have the  various contractors manufacture a set of 'structural spares' to  facilitate the repair of an Orbiter if one was damaged during  an accident. This contract was valued at &#36389 million  and consisted of a spare aft-fuselage, mid-fuselage, forward  fuselage halves, vertical tail and rudder, wings, elevons and a  body flap. These spares were later assembled into the orbiter  Endeavour. Atlantis was shipped to California to undergo  upgrades and modifications. These modifications include a drag  chute, new plumbing lines that configure the orbiter for  extended duration, more than 800 new heat protection tiles and  blankets and new insulation for the main landing gear.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: OV-104\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SPACE SHUTTLE\n      Short_Name: OV-104\n      Long_Name: Atlantis Space Shuttle\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Atlantis\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-25\n   Online_Resource: http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/atlantis.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.centralfloridavillaholiday.com/images/nasa_shuttle_launch.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1985-10-03\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

                                        "description": "Columbia, the oldest orbiter in the Shuttle fleet, is named after the Boston, Massachusetts based sloop captained by American Robert Gray. The spaceship Columbia has continued the pioneering legacy of its forebears, becoming the first Space Shuttle to fly into Earth orbit in 1981. Four sister ships joined the fleet over the next 10 years: Challenger, arriving in 1982 but destroyed four years later; Discovery, 1983; Atlantis, 1985; and Endeavour, built as a replacement for Challenger, 1991. A test vehicle, the Enterprise, was used for suborbital approach and landing tests and did not fly in space.\n\nColumbia was the first on-line orbiter to undergo the scheduled inspection and retrofit program. It was transported August 10, 1991, after its completion of mission STS-40, to prime Shuttle contractor Rockwell International's Palmdale, California assembly plant. The oldest orbiter in the fleet underwent approximately 50 modifications, including the addition of carbon brakes, drag chute, improved nose wheel steering, removal of development flight instrumentation and an enhancement of its thermal protection system. The orbiter returned to KSC February 9, 1992 to begin processing for mission STS-50 in June of that year.\n\nOn October 8, 1994, Columbia was transported to Palmdale California for its first ODMP. Approximately 90 modifications and upgrades were made to Columbia during this 6 month period. Modifications included upgrades to the main landing gear thermal barrier, tire pressure monitoring system and radiator drive circuitry. (Reference KSC Press Release 113-94 and Shuttle Status Report 10/10/94)\n\nOn September 24, 1999, Columbia was transported to Palmdale California for its second ODMP. While in California, workers will perform more than 100 modifications on the vehicle. Columbia will be the second orbiter outfitted with the multi-functional electronic display system (MEDS) or \"glass cockpit\". Last year, Shuttle Atlantis had the full-color, flat-panel displays installed on its flight deck during an OMDP. The new system improves crew interaction with the orbiter during flight and reduces the high cost of maintaining the outdated electromechanical cockpit displays currently onboard. (Reference KSC Press Release 74-99).\n\nOn February 1, 2003, Columbia was lost during re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. \n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: OV-102\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SPACE SHUTTLE\n      Short_Name: OV-102\n      Long_Name: Columbia Space Shuttle\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Columbia\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-24\n   Online_Resource: http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/columbia.html\n   Sample_Image: http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/columbia-logo.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The SRL payload, which first flew during STS-59 in April 1994, will again give scientists highly detailed information that will help them distinguish between human-induced environmental changes and other natural forms of change.\n\nSRL-2 will take radar images of the Earth's surface for Earth system sciences studies, including geology, geography, hydrology, oceanography, agronomy and botany.\n\nThe SRL payload is comprised of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR), and the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS). The German Space Agency (DARA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) are providing the X-SAR instrument.\n\nThe imaging radar of the SIR-C/X-SAR instruments has the ability to make measurements over virtually any region at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions. The radar waves can penetrate clouds, and under certain conditions, also can \"see\" through vegetation, ice and extremely dry sand. In many cases, radar is the only way scientists can explore inaccessible regions of the Earth's surface.\n\nThe SIR-C/X-SAR radar data provide information about how many of Earth's complex systems - those processes that control the movement of land, water, air and life - work together to make this a livable planet. The science team particularly wants to study the amount of vegetation coverage, the extent of snow packs, wetlands areas, geologic features such as rock types and their distribution, volcanic activity, ocean wave heights and wind speed. STS-68 will fly over the same sites that STS-59 observed so that scientists will be able to study seasonal changes that may have occurred in those areas between the missions.\n\nAn international team of 49 science investigators and three associates will conduct the SIR-C/X-SAR experiments. Thirteen nations are represented: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the United States.  The MAPS experiment will measure the global distribution of carbon monoxide in the troposphere, or lower atmosphere. Measurements of carbon monoxide, an important element in several chemical cycles, provide scientists with indications of how well the atmosphere can cleanse itself of \"greenhouse gases,\" chemicals that can increase the atmosphere's temperature.\n\nSTS-68 provided a continuation of NASA's Get Away Special (GAS) experiments program. The project gives a person or organization a chance to perform experiments in space on a Shuttle mission. Two universities, North Carolina A&T State University and University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the Swedish Space Corp., Soina, Sweden, will have small self-contained payloads flying during the STS-68 mission. Other GAS hardware in Endeavour's payload bay will carry 500,000 commemorative stamps for the U.S. Postal Service in recognition of the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.\n\nOther payloads aboard Endeavour include the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) which will fly for the first time, and the Military Applications of Ship Tracks (MAST) which will be making its second flight. BRIC experiments, sponsored by NASA's Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications, are designed to examine the effects of microgravity on a wide range of physiological processes in higher order plants and arthropod animals (e.g., insects, spiders, centipedes, crustaceans). MAST is an experiment sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and is part of a five-year research program developed by ONR to examine the effects of ships on the marine environment.\n\nThe Commercial Protein Crystal Growth (CPCG) experiment, the Chromosome and Plant Cell Division in Space Experiment (CHROMEX) and the Cosmic Radiation Effects and Activation Monitor (CREAM) experiment also will be carried aboard Endeavour.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: STS-68\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SPACE SHUTTLE\n      Short_Name: STS-68\n      Long_Name: Space Transport System STS-68\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Endeavour\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 57\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-30\n   Online_Resource: http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-68/mission-sts-68.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/134508main_sts-68-crew-sm.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1994-09-30\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The third flight of ATLAS focused on atmospheric and solar physics and consisted of the same experments as in ATLAS-2 with the addition of two co-manifested experiments. The ATLAS-3 instruments were mounted on Spacelab pallets in the Shuttle payload bay. The Shuttle's changing orientation to Earth placed the experiments in advantageous orbiting locations to observe the atmosphere and the Sun. The Shuttle orbiter orientation was either inertially fixed so that the selected instruments were pointed at the Sun, or nadir pointed for observations of the Earth's atmosphere. Crew members were in consultation with the investigators while controlling and monitoring the experiments. The ATLAS-3 core instruments consisted of: (1) Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM); (2) Measurement of the Solar Constant (SOLCON); (3) Solar Spectrum Measurement (SOLSPEC); (4) Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM); (5) Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS); and (6) Millimeter-Wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS). The ATLAS-3 payload was co-manifested with the 6th flight of the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV-06) experiment, the German Space Agency (DARA) Shuttle Pallet Satellite/Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere (SPAS/CRISTA) from Germany, and the Middle Atmospheric High Resolution Spectrograph Investigation (MAHRSI) from the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL).

Throughout the ATLAS series, scientists gathered new information to gain a better understanding of how the atmosphere reacts to natural and human-induced atmospheric changes. That knowledge helped us identify measures to keep our planet suitable for life for future generations.\n\nATLAS-1 flew aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on mission STS-45 in spring 1992. It was the first of up to nine ATLAS missions that were undertaken throughout one solar cycle, which lasted 11 years. During that period solar flares, sunspots and other magnetic activity in the sun changes from one extreme to the other and back.",

The Apollo 17 lunar module also carried the  name of Challenger. Like her historic predecessors, Space  Shuttle Challenger and her crews made significant contributions  to America's scientific growth.\n\nChallenger started out as a high-fidelity structural test  article (STA-099). The airframe was completed by Rockwell and  delivered to Lockheed Plant 42 for structural testing on  02/04/78. The orbiter structure had evolved under such  weight-saving pressure that virtually all components of the air  frame were required to handle significant structural  stress. With such an optimized design, it was difficult to  accurately predict mechanical and thermal loading with the  computer software available at the time. The only safe approach  was to submit the structural test article to intensive testing  and analysis. STA-099 underwent 11 months of intensive  vibration testing in a 43 ton steel rig built especially for  the Space Shuttle Test Program. The rig consisted of 256  hydraulic jacks, distributed over 836 load application  points. Under computer control, it was possible to simulate the  expected stress levels of launch, ascent, on-orbit, reentry and  landing. Three 1 million pound-force hyd raulic cylinders were  used to simulate the thrust from the Space Shuttle Main  Engines. Heating and thermal simulations were also done.  On  January 28, 1986, the Challenger and its seven-member crew were  lost 73 seconds after launch when a booster failure resulted in  the breakup of the vehicle.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: OV-099\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SPACE SHUTTLE\n      Short_Name: OV-099\n      Long_Name: Challenger Space Shuttle\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: challenger\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-24\n   Online_Resource: http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/shuttle/resources/orbiters/challenger.html\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

SPARTAN is a free-flying retrievable platform with two telescopes to study the solar wind, a continuous stream of electrons, heavy protons and heavy ions ejected from the sun and traveling through space at speeds of almost 1 million miles per hour. The solar wind frequently causes problems on Earth by disrupting navigation, communications and electrical power.\n\nThe STS-64 mission will also carry the Shuttle Plume Impingement Flight Experiment (SPIFEX). This experiment is designed to directly measure RCS plume loads in the far-field regime under actual on-orbit conditions. Discovery's payload bay also contains a GAS bridge assembly with 12 GAS canisters (G-178, G-254, G-312, G-325, G-417, G-453, G-454, G-456, G-485, G-506 and G-562). One additional experiment in the payload bay is the Trajectory Control Sensor (TCS) package positioned on an Adaptive Payload Carrier. It will provide relative trajectory data on a target vehicle operating in close proximity (less than 5000ft) of the Orbiter. The TCS will provide range and range rate data for target vehicles having a reflective surface. Additionally, the TCS provides bearing, bearing rate, attitude, and attitude rates for target vehicles utilizing special retro-reflectors.\n\nIn Discovery's middeck area, STS-64 will carry the Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER) system, the Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE), the Biological Research in Canister III (BRIC-III) experiment, the Radiation Monitoring Equipment III (RME-III) experiment.

This radar system produced unrivaled 3-D images of the Earth's Surface. The mission was launched at 1231 on February 11, 2000 onboard the space shuttle Endeavour, and led by Commander Kevin Kregel. The crew was Pilot Dominic L. Pudwill Gorie and Mission Specialists Janet L. Kavandi, Janice E. Voss, Mamoru Mohri from the National Space Development Agency (Japanese Space Agency), and Gerhard P. J. Thiele from DARA (German Space Agency). This videotape shows a press briefing about a mechanical problem that the shuttle was having. There was discussion about possibly scrubbing the launch due to the problem with the Enhanced Master Events Controller. A problem with a fuel pump part had also become evident and there was discussion about the impact that this could have on the flight. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: STS-99\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SPACE SHUTTLE\n      Short_Name: STS-99\n      Long_Name: Space Transport System STS-99\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: CAMERAS\n      Short_Name: SRTM\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 126 nm\n      Orbit_Inclination: 57 degrees\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-08-21\n   Online_Resource: http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-99/mission-sts-99.html\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2000-02-11\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The experiments covered several disciplines. For the materials processing discipline, higher-quality crystals were grown by two methods; namely, seed crystal growth in a saturated solution and condensation from the vapor phase. The two fluid physics experiments studied the dynamic behavior of rotating and oscillating liquid drops, and the convection processes found in planetary atmospheres and in stellar interiors. The performance of equipment and facilities specially designed for investigations on the Spacelab Life Sciences mission series was evaluated. The investigations selected for the Spacelab 3 mission originated in the United States, France, and India, and represented a total of five different disciplines, including material science, life sciences, fluid mechanics, atmospheric science, and astronomy. Two of the investigations, one in material science and one in astronomy, had already flown aboard Spacelab 1. Many of the Spacelab 3 investigations were scheduled to be modified and reflown on later missions to further explore the discoveries of this mission. Some of the experiments were located in the module, some on the pallet in the payload bay, and one at middeck. Spacelab 3 consisted of a Spacelab long module and a pallet. The mission successfully demonstrated the capability of Spacelab for multidiscipline research in microgravity.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: STS-51B\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SPACE SHUTTLE\n      Short_Name: STS-51B\n      Long_Name: Space Transport System STS-51B\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Challenger\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 28.45 degrees\n      Perigee: 370 km\n      Apogee: 370 km\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-29\n   Online_Resource: http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-51/mission-sts-51.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/134455main_sts-51b-crew-sm.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1985-04-29\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The first ATLAS was flown on STS 45 in March 1992. The ATLAS series was intended to study the composition of the middle atmosphere and its possible variations due to solar changes over the course of an 11-year solar cycle. The second flight of ATLAS focused on atmospheric and solar physics studies and did not include the experiments on space plasma physics and astronomy that were flown with the ATLAS 1 payload. The ATLAS 2 instruments were mounted on Spacelab pallets (provided by ESA) in the Shuttle payload bay. The ATLAS 2 instrument power supply, command and data handling system and temperature control systems were housed in a pressurized container called an igloo located in front of the pallet. The Shuttle's changing orientation to Earth placed the experiments in advantageous orbiting locations to observe the atmosphere and the Sun. The Shuttle orbiter orientation was either inertially fixed so that selected instruments were pointed at the Sun, or nadir pointed for observations of the Earth's atmosphere. Crew members were in consultation with the investigators while controlling and monitoring the experiments. The atmospheric and solar instrument data were also used to provide correlative measurements with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and the Solar-Backscattered Ultraviolet (SBUV/2) instruments on board the NOAA polar orbiters. The ATLAS 2 core instruments consisted of: (1) Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM); (2) Measurement of the Solar Constant (SOLCON); (3) Solar Spectrum Measurement (SOLSPEC); (4) Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM); (5) Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS); and, (6) Millimeter-Wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS). The ATLAS 2 payload was co-manifested with the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV 05) experiment and integrated into the ATLAS Science Plan.",

Another of his ships was the Endeavour, the namesake of NASA's newest orbiter.\n\nDiscovery benefited from lessons learned in the construction and testing of Enterprise, Columbia and Challenger. At rollout, its weight was some 6,870 pounds less than Columbia. Two orbiters, Challenger and Discovery, were modified at KSC to enable them to carry the Centaur upper stage in the payload bay. These modifications included extra plumbing to load and vent Centaur's cryogenic (L02/LH2) propellants (other IUS/PAM upper stages use solid propellants), and controls on the aft flight deck for loading and monitoring the Centaur stage. No Centaur flight was ever flown and after the loss of Challenger it was decided that the risk was too great to launch a shuttle with a fueled Centaur upper stage in the payload bay.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: OV-103\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SPACE SHUTTLE\n      Short_Name: OV-103\n      Long_Name: Discovery Space Shuttle\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Discovery\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-25\n   Online_Resource: http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/discovery.html\n   Sample_Image: http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/discovery-logo.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1984-08-30\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

To allow a formation flying demonstration\nfor a wide ran ge of applications, the technologies for the\ncontrol of the relative distance cover both the regime of close\nand wide formations ranging from several hundreds of meters up\nto 100 km. In contrast to the relaxed orbit control\nrequirements of nowadays formations, Gemini aims at a relative\nposition keeping of several cm to several meters, that is\nexpected to be of significance for many of the upcoming\nformation flying missions and, in addition, paves the way for\neven more advanced requirements, such as for SMART 2. To\nachieve that level of control accuracy, the Gemini sensors have\nto provide relative position measurements in the range of\nmillimeters or better, that may not be achievable solely using\na spaceborne GPS receiver.",

The primary mission objectives were to perform rendezvous and\n  four  docking  tests  with  the Agena target vehicle and to execute an\n  extravehicular  activity (EVA) experiment. Ten technological, medical,\n  and   scientific  experiments  were  carried  on  board.  Of  the  six\n  scientific  experiments  only  the Agena micrometeorite collection was\n  successful. the others -- (1) zodiacal light photography, (2) frog egg\n  growth,  (3)  synoptic terrain photography, (4) nuclear emulsions, and\n  (5)  spectrophotography of clouds -- were incomplete, owing to a large\n  loss of fuel and early termination of the mission. The EVA docking and\n  other  maneuvers  were  canceled. The spacecraft reentered the earth's\n  atmosphere  after  6.5 orbits and landed in the pacific ocean on March\n  17, 1966.\nAuxiliary Information\n  Launch Date and Time : 1966-03-16 16:48:00\n  Epoch Date and Time :  1966-03-17\n  Orbit Type :  Geocentric\n  Apogee(km) :     298.\n  Perigee(km) :    285.\n  Inclination :   28.88\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/gemini/gemini-viii/gemini-viii.html\"",

The blunt, cone-shaped spacecraft was 3.048  cm  in  diameter  at  the  rear  of  the craft. Primary mission objectives were to demonstrate (1) three rendezvous techniques, (2) an extravehicular  activity  (EVA) to test the astronaut maneuvering unit (AMU),  and  (3)  precision  landing capability. scientific objectives included obtaining zodiacal light and airglow horizon photographs. Two micrometeorite studies were to be carried out, and there were also one medical  and  two  technological experiments. the agena target vehicle failed  to  achieve  orbit,  and  the  agena micrometeorite experiment hardware  was  lost.  Other experiments functioned normally. The three rendezvous techniques were demonstrated, although docking could not be achieved  due  to  a failure of the augmented target-docking shroud to jettison. The EVA was curtailed due to fogging of the visor and energy expended by the astronaut. Reentry was routinely accomplished after 47 orbits on june 6, 1966, within 3.2 km of the target point.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GEMINI-9\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Space Stations/Manned Spacecraft\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: GEMINI\n      Short_Name: GEMINI-9\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: TITAN II (9)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 28.86 degrees\n      Perigee: 270 km\n      Apogee: 272 km\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-24\n   Online_Resource: http://www.astronautix.com/flights/gemini9.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://www.astronautix.com/graphics/0/10074373.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1966-06-03\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

It was designed to test the compatibility of rendezvous and docking systems for American and Soviet spacecraft in order to open the way for future joint human flights. There were a number of difficulties that both nations had to resolve in the mission design before they could assure a safe docking of both spacecraft and an on-orbit meeting of crewmembers. The technical challenges included different measuring systems, the different\nspacecraft and thus mating adapter designs, and different air pressures and mixtures.\n\nThe Apollo spacecraft was the same design as those used on lunar\nexploration missions. Several modifications were made for the\nApollo-Soyuz mission, however, including the addition of\npropellants for the reaction control system, heaters for\ntemperature control, and extra equipment needed to operate the\nDocking Module. The Soyuz had been the Soviet's primary\nspacecraft since 1967. It consisted of three basic\nmodules?Orbital, Descent, and Instrument?no major modifications\nwere needed.\n\nThe mission began with the Soyuz launch on July 15, 1975, followed by the Apollo launch seven hours later. The docking in space of, the two spacecraft took place at 2:17 p.m. U.S. central time on July 17. Two days worth of joint operations followed. After separation, the Soyuz remained in space for almost two days before landing in the U.S.S.R. on July 21. The Apollo spacecraft remained in space for another three days before splashing down near Hawaii on July 24.\n\nThe mission was a resounding success for both Americans and Soviets. They achieved their goal of obtaining flight experience for rendezvous and docking of human spacecraft. In addition, they also demonstrated in-flight intervehicular crew transfer, as well as accomplished a series of scientific experiments. The ASTP mission was not only successful as a space effort, but the mutual confidence and trust it engendered made it a huge step in\ninternational cooperation during the Cold War.\n\nAdditional information available at\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/missions/apollo-soyuz/the-apollo-soyuz-mission/\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]",

This highly successful spacecraft has helped scientists answer\nfundamental questions about the causes and makeup of the aurora. \n\nFAST was launched on August 21, 1996 from a Pegasus rocket into a highly\nelliptical orbit. It crosses Earth's auroral zones (donut shaped regions\ncentered on the poles) four times each orbit, and only collects high-resolution\ndata (\"snapshots\") while in those zones. It ventures high into the charged\nparticle environment of the aurora to measure the electric and magnetic fields,\nplasma waves, energetic electrons and ions, ion mass composition, and thermal\nplasma density and temperature.\n\nThe FAST instrument set consists of sixteen electrostatic analyzers, four\nelectric field langmuir probes suspended on 30 m wire booms, two electric field\nlangmuir probes on 3 m extendible booms, searchcoil and fluxgate magnetometers\nand a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The science investigation makes\nextremely temporal and spatial resolution measurements of the auroral plasma at\napogee altitude. The instrument hardware consists of the sensor assemblies and\nan instrument data processor. The instrument electronics include a 32-bit data\nprocessing unit that performs the science data processing and recording in a\none gigabit, solid-state memory. The stored data are transferred to the ground\nat one of three selectable high data rates of 900 Kbps, 1.5 Mbps or 2.25 Mbps.\nThe instruments weigh 51 kg; the total observatory mass is 191 kg. The FAST\nmission is in a 351 x 4175 km orbit with an 83? inclination.\n\nThe FAST observatory is a 12 rpm, spin-stabilized spacecraft with its spin axis\noriented parallel to the orbit axis. Spin rate and spin-axis orientation are\nmaintained by two magnetic torquer coils, one spinning Sun sensor, one horizon\ncrossing indicator and a spacecraft magnetometer. The Attitude Control System\n(ACS) provides closed-loop spin-rate control. Spin-axis precession is performed\nopen loop and is closed via ground commands. After computation on the ground,\nattitude knowledge is accurate to within one degree.\n\nThe body-mounted solar array contains 5.6 m2 of solar cells that can distribute\n52 W of orbit average power to the spacecraft and instruments. The orbit\naverage power consumption of the spacecraft hardware is 33 W. The instruments\nconsume 19 W orbit average power, 39 W when operating. Instruments are\nfrequently powered off in order to maintain a positive energy balance.\n\nThe data system for the FAST mission consists of dual 8085, 8-bit spacecraft\ncomputers. The spacecraft computers perform health and safety functions, power\ndistribution, data encoding/decoding and launch vehicle interface. A\nmulti-element micropatch antenna mounted on a boom above the spacecraft\nsupports ground communications. Commands are uplinked at 2 Kbps. Health and\nsafety data is telemetered to the ground at 4 Kbps. A Transportable Orbital\nTracking Station (TOTS) was placed in Alaska to collect real-time science\ntelemetry while the spacecraft is passing through the northern aurora. TOTS is\nhighly automated and portable; it has an 8 m antenna with 200 W of uplink power\nand can be packed for shipment in three ISO containers.\n \nThe FAST instruments consist of:\nElectric Field Experiment: The electric field experiment is composed of three\northogonal boom pairs. Spherical sensors deployed on radial wire and axial\nstacer booms will provide information on the plasma density and electron\ntemperature.\n\nMagnetic Field Experiment: The magnetic field experiment consists of two\nmagnetometers mounted 180? apart on deployable graphite epoxy booms. The search\ncoil magnetometer uses a three-axis sensor system to provide magnetic field\ndata over the frequency range of 10 Hz to 2.5 kHz. The flux gate magnetometer\nis a three-axis system using high, stable, low noise, ring core sensors to\nprovide magnetic field information for DC to 100 Hz.\n\nTime-of-Flight Energy Angle Mass Spectrograph (TEAMS): The TEAMS instrument is\na high sensitivity, mass-resolving spectrometer that measures full\nthree-dimension distribution functions of the major ion species with one spin\nof the spacecraft. The TEAMS experiment covers the core of all plasma\ndistributions of importance in the auroral region.\n\nElectrostatic Analyzers (ESA): Sixteen ESAs configured in four stacks will be\nused for both electron and ion measurements. The four stacks are placed around\nthe spacecraft such that the entire package is provided a full 360? field of\nview. The ESAs can provide a 64-step energy sweep, covering approximately 3 eV\nto 30 KeV up to 16 times per second.\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/fast/\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: FAST\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: FAST\n      Long_Name: Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Explorer 70\n      Short_Name: SMEX/FAST\n      Short_Name: Small Explorer/FAST\n      Short_Name: 24285\n      Short_Name: 1996-049A\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MFS/FAST\n      Short_Name: EFS/FAST\n      Short_Name: ESA/FAST\n      Short_Name: TEAMS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 83 degrees\n      Period: 133 m\n      Perigee: 350 km\n      Apogee: 4175 km\n      Orbit_Type: HEO > Highly Elliptical Orbit\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/fast/intro.html\n   Sample_Image: http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/fast/graphics/fast.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1996-08-21\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Other notable craft in the series include Explorer 38 (launched July 4, 1968; also known as Radio Astronomy Explorer), which measured galactic radio sources and studied low frequencies in space, and Explorer 53 (launched May 7, 1975; also known as Small Astronomy Satellite-C), which was sent out to explore X-ray sources both inside and outside the Milky Way Galaxy.",

The attitude control system is used to keep the spin axis aligned with the orbit normal and to maintain the spin rate. Spin axis control is achieved by a chargeable permanent magnet system which is operated upon command and reacts with the earth's field to produce precession of several degrees per minute. With this system the spin axis was kept within 10 degrees of the orbit normal for several weeks at a time, although larger deviations have been tolerated. The spin rate was observed to decay at 0.05 rpm per day. Periodic use of the spin rate control system has compensated for spin decay. This system is analogous to a DC motor in which the entire satellite is the armature.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: EXPLORER-31 (DME-A)\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: EXPLORER\n      Short_Name: EXPLORER-31 (DME-A)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Explorer-A\n      Short_Name: Explorer 31\n      Short_Name: 01806\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: SPHERICAL MASS SPECTROMETER\n      Short_Name: ELECTROSTATIC ANALYZERS\n      Short_Name: ENERGETIC ELECTRON CURRENT MONITOR\n      Short_Name: ELECTRON TEMPERATURE PROBE\n      Short_Name: MAGNETIC ION-MASS SPECTROMETER\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 79.80 degrees\n      Period: 119.70 min\n      Perigee: 505 km\n      Apogee: 2833 km\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-12-14\n   Online_Resource: http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=AD0656730\n   Sample_Image: http://www.daviddarling.info/images/DME.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1965-11-29\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The first is a space-borne sensor system consisting of seven proven sensors to provide data for global, real-time specification, and 4 hour forecast capability. The second is a series of regional ground networks that augment the space based sensors for real time, high resolution coverage in theater.

The F3C mission was successfully launched on 15 April 2006. Six identical micro satellites, each carrying an advanced GPS radio occultation (RO) receiver, a Tiny Ionospheric Photometer (TIP) and a Tri Band Beacon (TBB) were deployed. The satellites have since been raised by Taiwan's National Space Organization (NSPO) to their final orbit altitude at 800km to achieve an operational constellation of six orbital planes separated by 30 degrees. The payload science data are currently being downloaded every orbit via two NOAA TT&C stations (in Alaska and Norway) and one NSF/NASA station in McMurdo, Antarctica and transferred to the COSMIC Data Analysis and Archival Center (CDAAC) at UCAR in Boulder. The CDAAC currently processes the COSMIC science data in near real time - Ninety percent of RO profiles are delivered to operational weather centers within 3 hours of observation. CDAAC also reprocesses data in a more accurate post-processed mode (within 6 weeks of observation) for COSMIC as well as other missions including GPS/MET, CHAMP, SAC-C, and GRACE.\n\nCOSMIC is currently providing between 1000-2500 daily RO profiles in the neutral atmosphere, 1000-2500 daily electron density profiles and total electron content arcs, and TIP radiance products. The data have already demonstrated their value for operational weather forecasting, hurricane forecasting, and investigations of the atmospheric boundary layer. The data have been used extensively to test ionospheric models and their use in operational space weather models is under development. COSMIC GPS RO data also have the potential to be of great benefit to climate studies due to their demonstrated high precision and global and diurnal sampling coverage.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3\n      Long_Name: Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: FORMSAT 3A\n      Short_Name: FORMSAT 3B\n      Short_Name: FORMSAT 3C\n      Short_Name: FORMSAT 3D\n      Short_Name: FORMSAT 3E\n      Short_Name: FORMSAT 3F\n      Short_Name: 2006-011A\n      Short_Name: 2006-011B\n      Short_Name: 2006-011C\n      Short_Name: 2006-011D\n      Short_Name: 2006-011E\n      Short_Name: 2006-011F\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: RO\n      Short_Name: TBB\n      Short_Name: TIP\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 72 degrees\n      Period: 95 m\n      Perigee: 496 km\n      Apogee: 540 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Inclined Non-Polar\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/\n   Online_Resource: http://cosmic-io.cosmic.ucar.edu/cdaac/\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nspo.org.tw/2008e/projects/project3/hot.shtml?right=no\n   Sample_Image: http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/images/rocksat.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2006-04-15\n      Launch_Site: Vandenberg Air Force Base, USA\n      Design_Life: 5 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NSF/UCAR\n      Primary_Sponsor: TAIWAN/NSPO\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/DOD/USAF\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NOAA\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/DOD/ONR\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Since its preliminary inception, HST was designed to be a different type of mission for NASA -- a long-term space-based observatory. To accomplish this goal and protect the spacecraft against instrument and equipment failures, NASA had   always planned on regular servicing missions. Hubble has special grapple fixtures, 76 handholds, and stabilized in all three axes.

                                "description": "Launched in October 2006, the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or STEREO, has provided scientists a unique and revolutionary view of the Sun-Earth System. Composed of two nearly identical observatories -- one ahead of Earth in its orbit, the other trailing behind --  STEREO has traced the flow of energy and matter from the Sun to Earth. \n\n \nSolar ejections, like coronal mass ejections (CMEs), are the most powerful drivers of the Sun-Earth connection. Yet despite their importance, scientists don't fully understand the origin and evolution of CMEs, nor their structure or extent in interplanetary space. STEREO's unique 3D images of the structure of CMEs is enabling scientists to determine their fundamental nature and origin.\n\nSTEREO is also a key addition to the fleet of space weather detection satellites. It provides more accurate alerts for the arrival time of Earth-directed solar ejections with its unique side-viewing perspective.\n\n \nOn Oct. 1, 2014, NASA mission operations lost communication with one of the spacecraft, STEREO-B. Efforts to regain contact are ongoing. STEREO-A continues to operate normally and provide views of parts of the far side of the Sun otherwise unseeable from Earth\u2019s perspective.",

The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell. The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube. The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft. A support structure extended radially out from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power. Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment. Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command. The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem. A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit. The spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer atmospheric sounder, meteorological data collection and transmission system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer. It operated at at 75 degrees West as GOES-EAST, but on July 30, 1984, GOES 5 VAS experienced a failure, thus NOAA had to relocate GOES 6 to a more central 98 degrees West position, and to reactivate GOES 1 and GOES 4 for the acquisition and relay of VISSR information, respectively, from the western U.S. For more information on GOES satellites: http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Operations/GOES/index.html",

                                        "description": "GOES 8 (GOES-I) was launched on April 13, 1994. On Tuesday April 1, 2003 GOES-12 (Formerly Referred to as GOES-M) replaced GOES-8 as the operational GOES East Satellite. NOAA deactivated the satellite on May 5, 2004 and will boost it into an orbit 350 kilometers above its original geostationary position, where it will be disposed safely in three controlled burns. GOES I-M represented the next generation of meteorological satellites and introduces two new features. The first feature, flexible scan, offers small-scale area imaging that lets meteorologists take pictures of local weather trouble spots. This allows them to improve short-term forecasts over local areas. The second feature, simultaneous and independent imaging and sounding, is designed to allow weather forecasters to use multiple measurements of weather phenomena to increase the accuracy of their forecasts. Each satellite in the series carries two major instruments: an Imager and a Sounder. These instruments acquire high resolution visible and infrared data, as well as temperature and moisture profiles of the atmosphere. They continuously transmit these data to ground terminals where the data are processed for rebroadcast to primary weather services both in the United States and around the world, including the global research community. The GOES I-M mission ran from the mid-1990s into the first decade of the 21st century. Each element of the mission has been designed to meet all in-orbit performance requirements for at least five years. The GOES I-M system performed the following basic functions: + Acquisition, processing, and dissemination of imaging and sounding data. + Acquisition and dissemination of Space Environment Monitor (SEM) data. + Reception and relay of data from ground-based Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) that are situated in carefully selected urban and remote areas to the NOAA Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) station. + Continuous relay of Weather Facsimile (WEFAX) and other data to users, independent of all other functions. + Relay of distress signals from people, aircraft, or marine vessels to the search and rescue ground stations of the Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) system. GOES provides the instantaneous relay functions for the SARSAT system. A dedicated search and rescue transponder on board GOES is designed to detect emergency distress signals originating from Earth-based sources. These unique identification signals are normally combined with signals received by a low-Earth orbiting satellite system and relayed to a search and rescue ground terminal. The combined data are used to perform effective search and rescue operations. The GOES I-M system serves a region covering the central and eastern Pacific Ocean; North, Central, and South America; and the central and western Atlantic Ocean. Pacific coverage includes Hawaii and the Gulf of Alaska. This is accomplished by two satellites, GOES West located at 135 west longitude and GOES East at 75 west longitude. A common ground station, the CDA station located at Wallops, Virginia, supports the interface to both satellites. The NOAA Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC), in Suitland, Maryland, provides spacecraft scheduling, health and safety monitoring, and engineering analyses. Delivery of products involves ground processing of the raw instrument data for radiometric calibration and Earth location information, and retransmission to the satellite for relay to the data user community. The processed data are received at the control center and disseminated to the National Weather Service's (NWS) National Meteorological Center, Camp Springs, Maryland, and NWS forecast offices, including the National Hurricane Center, Miami, Florida, and the National Severe Storms Forecast Center, Kansas City, Missouri. Processed data are also received by Department of Defense installations, universities, and numerous private commercial users.

The multi-element spectral channels simultaneously sweep east-west and west-east along a north-to-south path by means of a two-axis mirror scan system. The instrument can produce full-Earth disc images, sector images that contain the edges of the Earth, and various sizes of area scans completely enclosed within the Earth scene using a new flexible scan system. Scan selection permits rapid continuous viewing of local areas for monitoring of mesoscale (regional) phenomena and accurate wind determination.

                                        "description": "The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite GOES 10 is the third satellite in a series of next generation geosynchronous spacecraft, referred to as GOES-NEXT and represented by the GOES I through GOES M spacecraft. The GOES-NEXT series is a joint effort on the part of NASA and NOAA to provide continued operational monitoring of weather systems primarily over the United States, distribute meteorological data to regional and national weather offices within the USA, contribute to the development of an environmental data collection network, contribute to the search and rescue program, improve the capability for forcasting and provide real-time warnings of solar distrubances, and to extend knowledge and understanding of atmospheric processes to improve short and long-term weather forecasts.  The GOES-NEXT series extends the capabilities of the previous GOES 1-7 spacecraft. The GOES I-M spacecraft will be placed over the equator at 135 deg West or 75 deg West. The design allows unobstructed views of the Earth for operational coverage by the spacecraft sensors. The spacecraft configuration is a compact box-shaped main body that carries the Earth-observing instruments, a continuous-drive solar array attached to the south panel through a yoke assembly, and a solar pointing instrument gimbal mounted on the solar panel yoke. The main body accomodates the sensors, electronics, and support subsystems. The communication antennas, except the Tracking, Telemetry, and Command (TT&C) antenna, are hard-mounted to the Earth-facing panel. The Propulsion Module consists of the fuel and oxidizer tanks for the bipropellant propulsion subsystem mounted on the central cylinder. The Attitude and Orbit Control Substem (AOCS) provides attitude control of the spacecraft. The AOCS consists of the sensors, electronics, and the actuators. The GOES power is generated from the solar array and two 12 A-hr batteries. Power is automatically regulated during solar eclipses. A conical shaped solar sail at the end of a 58-foot boom balances torque caused by solar radiation. The main body of the spacecraft is a 2-meter cube. In its deployed orbit configuration, the overall length is about 27 meters. Initial mass was about 4640 pounds, including fuel. Design lifetime is about five years.  The Image Navigation/Registration (INR) system provides Imager and Sounder data products in real-time to users. The Communications, Command, and Data Handling subsystem is comprised of antennas, receivers, transponders, transmitters, data encoders and encryptors and multiplexers. The Tracking Telemetry and Command (TT&C) subsystem provides the necessary monitor and command link between the spacecraft and the ground stations.  The GOES-NEXT instruments consist of the following: (1) Earth Imaging System, a 5-channel visible and infrared radiometer which provides Earth imagery 24 hours a day; (2) Sounding System, a 19-channel discrete-filter radiometer for obtaining atmospheric temperature and moisture soundings; (3) a Space Environment Monitor (SEM), which consists of a magnetic field sensor, a solar X-ray sensor, an energetic particle sensor (EPS), and a High Energy Proton and Alpha Detector (HEPAD); (4) a Search and Rescue subsystem (SARSAT), which receives signals from 406 MHz distress beacons and relays them to the ground; (5) a Data Collection System (DCS) for collecting and relaying real-time information from Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) such as buoys, balloons, remote weather stations, ships, and aircraft; and (6) a Weather Facsimile (WEFAX) system which relays processed weather imagary from the Wallops Island station to the user community. The SEC package has been frequently eratic during 2003.",

From a position about 22,300 miles above Earth, the advanced weather satellite will keep an unblinking eye on atmospheric conditions in the Eastern United States and Atlantic Ocean.  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-O represents a continuation of the newest generation of environmental satellites built by Boeing  for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the technical guidance and project management of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD. GOES satellites provide the familiar weather pictures seen on United States television newscasts every day. The GOES imaging and sounding instruments (built by ITT) feature flexible scans for small-scale area viewing in regions of the visible and infrared spectrum allowing meteorologists to improve short-term forecasts. GOES provides nearly continuous imaging and sounding, which allow forecasters to better measure changes in atmospheric temperature and moisture distributions and hence increase the accuracy of their forecasts. GOES environmental information is used for a host of applications, including weather monitoring and prediction models, ocean temperatures and moisture locations, climate studies, cryosphere (ice, snow, glaciers) detection and extent, land temperatures and crop conditions, and hazards detection. The GOES-O&P Imagers have improved resolution in the 13 micrometer channel from 8 km to 4 km. The finer spatial resolution allows an improved cloud-top product, height of atmospheric motion vectors and volcanic ash detection. GOES-O continues the improved image navigation and registration, additional power and fuel lifetime capability, space weather, solar x-ray imaging, search and rescue, and communication services as provided on GOES-13.  GOES-P is also in ground storage following the completion of environmental testing and is prepared for an April 2009 launch readiness with a July 2010, engineering handover date requirement.",

                                        "description": "GOES 9 was launched on May 23, 1995. GOES-9, which is currently partially operational, is being provided to the Japanese Meteorological Agency to replace their failing geostationary satellite.  GOES I-M represents the next generation of meteorological satellites and introduces two new features.  The first feature, flexible scan, offers small-scale area imaging that lets meteorologists take pictures of local weather trouble spots. This allows them to improve short-term forecasts over local areas. The second feature, simultaneous and independent imaging and sounding, is designed to allow weather forecasters to use multiple measurements of weather phenomena to increase the accuracy of their forecasts.  Each satellite in the series carries two major instruments: an Imager and a Sounder. These instruments acquire high resolution visible and infrared data, as well as temperature and moisture profiles of the atmosphere. They continuously transmit these data to ground terminals where the data are processed for rebroadcast to primary weather services both in the United States and around the world, including the global research community.  The GOES I-M mission is scheduled to run from the mid-1990s into the first decade of the 21st century.  Each element of the mission has been designed to meet all in-orbit performance requirements for at least five years. The GOES I-M system performs the following basic functions: + Acquisition, processing, and dissemination of imaging and sounding data. + Acquisition and dissemination of Space Environment Monitor (SEM) data. + Reception and relay of data from ground-based Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) that are situated in carefully selected urban and remote areas to the NOAA Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) station. + Continuous relay of Weather Facsimile (WEFAX) and other data to users, independent of all other functions. + Relay of distress signals from people, aircraft, or marine vessels to the search and rescue ground stations of the Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) system. GOES provides the instantaneous relay functions for the SARSAT system. A dedicated search and rescue transponder on board GOES is designed to detect emergency distress signals originating from Earth-based sources. These unique identification signals are normally combined with signals received by a low-Earth orbiting satellite system and relayed to a search and rescue ground terminal. The combined data are used to perform effective search and rescue operations. The GOES I-M system serves a region covering the central and eastern Pacific Ocean; North, Central, and South America; and the central and western Atlantic Ocean. Pacific coverage includes Hawaii and the Gulf of Alaska. This is accomplished by two satellites, GOES West located at 135 west longitude and GOES East at 75 west longitude. A common ground station, the CDA station located at Wallops, Virginia, supports the interface to both satellites. The NOAA Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC), in Suitland, Maryland, provides spacecraft scheduling, health and safety monitoring, and engineering analyses.  Delivery of products involves ground processing of the raw instrument data for radiometric calibration and Earth location information, and retransmission to the satellite for relay to the data user community. The processed data are received at the control center and disseminated to the National Weather Service's (NWS) National Meteorological Center, Camp Springs, Maryland, and NWS forecast offices, including the National Hurricane Center, Miami, Florida, and the National Severe Storms Forecast Center, Kansas City, Missouri. Processed data are also received by Department of Defense installations, universities, and numerous private commercial users. *The GOES-9 satellite was replaced by GOES-10 in July 1998*  MAIN SPACECRAFT DESIGN ELEMENTS Mission life            5 years, minimum Dimensions  Main body              2 meter (7 foot) cube  Deployed length        27 meters (88 feet) Weight                  2100 kg (4600 lb) Orbit                   Geosynchronous  Altitude               36,000 km (22,000 mi)  Longitude              75W and 135W  Latitude               equatorial, within 0.5 degree Power                   1050 watts @ 42 volts, solar array; battery backup Launch vehicle          Atlas-I/Centaur (GOES-I/K), Atlas-II/Centaur (GOES-L/M) Communications          Imager and Sounder in GVAR format at 2.1 Mbits/sec GOES-I/M IMAGER The GOES Imager is a multi-channel instrument designed to sense radiant and solar-reflected energy from sampled areas of the Earth. The multi-element spectral channels simultaneously sweep east-west and west-east along a north-to-south path by means of a two-axis mirror scan system. The instrument can produce full-Earth disc images, sector images that contain the edges of the Earth, and various sizes of area scans completely enclosed within the Earth scene using a new flexible scan system. Scan selection permits rapid continuous viewing of local areas for monitoring of mesoscale (regional) phenomena and accurate wind determination.

It is designed to provide data from which atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles, surface and cloud-top temperatures, and ozone distribution can be deduced by mathematical analysis. It operates independently of and simultaneously with the Imager, using a similarly flexible scan system. The Sounder's multi-element detector array assemblies simultaneously sample four separate fields or atmospheric columns. A rotating filter wheel, which brings spectral filters into the optical path of the detector array, provides the infrared channel definition.

The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell. The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube. The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft. A support structure extended radially out from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power. Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment. Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command. The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem. A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit. The spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer atmospheric sounder, meteorological data collection and transmission system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer. GOES 6 was moved from its 135 degrees West position to a more central 98 degrees West position when GOES 5 failed on July 29, 1984.

GOES satellites provide the familiar weather pictures seen on United States television newscasts every day. The GOES imaging and sounding instruments (built by ITT) feature flexible scans for small-scale area viewing in regions of the visible and infrared spectrum allowing meteorologists to improve short-term forecasts. GOES provides nearly continuous imaging and sounding, which allow forecasters to better measure changes in atmospheric temperature and moisture distributions and hence increase the accuracy of their forecasts. GOES environmental information is used for a host of applications, including weather monitoring and prediction models, ocean temperatures and moisture locations, climate studies, cryosphere (ice, snow, glaciers) detection and extent, land temperatures and crop conditions, and hazards detection. The GOES-O&P Imagers have improved resolution in the 13 micrometer channel from 8 km to 4 km. The finer spatial resolution allows an improved cloud-top product, height of atmospheric motion vectors and volcanic ash detection. GOES-P continues the improved image navigation and registration, additional power and fuel lifetime capability, space weather, solar x-ray imaging, search and rescue, and communication services as provided on GOES-13. GOES-P Launches! The GOES-P satellite launched at 6:57 p.m. EST March 4 aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta IV rocket from Launch Complex 37B at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

The communications systems is also used to study the solar corona and to search for gravitational waves. Secondary objectives included interplanetary and planetary physics investigations during the initial Earth-Jupiter phase and investigations in the Jovian magnetosphere. The spacecraft used a Jupiter swingby in Feb. 1992 to transfer to a heliospheric orbit with high heliocentric inclination, and will pass over the rotational south pole of the sun in mid-1994 at 2 AU, and over the north pole in mid-1995. A second solar orbit will take Ulysses again over the south and north poles in years 2000 and 2001, respectively. The spacecraft is powered by a single radio-isotope generator.

ACRIM II followed on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite\n(UARS) in 1991. ACRIMSAT data will be correlated with possible global warming\ndata, ice cap shrinkage data, and ozone layer depletion data. It is theorized\nthat as much as 25 percent of the Earth's total global warming may be solar in\norigin due to small increases in the Sun's total energy output since the last\ncentury. By measuring incoming solar radiation and adding measurements of ocean\nand atmosphere currents and temperatures, as well as surface temperatures,\nclimatologists will be able to improve their predictions of climate and global\nwarming over the next century.

The spacecraft successfully provided simultaneous scientific measurements at widely dispersed locations in heliocentric orbit. It returned the first data on the tenuous solar atmosphere and later recorded the passage of Comet Kohoutek's tail in 1974. \n\nAlong with Pioneers 7, 8, and 9, the spacecraft formed a ring of solar weather stations spaced along Earth's orbit. Measurements by the four Pioneers were used to predict solar storms for approximately 1,000 primary users, including the Federal Aviation Administration; commercial airlines; power companies; communication companies; military organizations; and entities involved in surveying, navigation, and electronic prospecting. \n\nBy December 1990, Pioneer 6 had circled the Sun twentynine times (traveling 24.8 billion kilometers) and had been operational for twenty years -- a record for a deep space probe. Its original slated lifetime had been only six months. \n\nOn 15 December 1996, the spacecraft's primary transmitter failed, but during a track on 11 July 1996, ground controllers switched on the backup transmitter. \n\nOf the spacecraft's six scientific instruments, two (the plasma analyzer and the cosmic-ray detector) still continue to function. \n\nNASA maintains contact with the spacecraft once or twice each year. For example, 1 hour's worth of scientific data was collected on 29 July and 15 December 1995 (although the primary transmitter failed soon after that), and again on 6 October 1997, more than thirty years after launch. The probe's solar arrays continue to deteriorate, although the transmitters can be turned on at perihelion when the solar flux is strong enough to provide sufficient power. \n\nOn 8 December 2000, to commemorate its thirty-fifth anniversary of operation, ground controllers established successful contact with the spacecraft for about 2 hours.\n\nInformation provided by http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Alpha&Alias=Pioneer%206&Letter=P&Display=ReadMore\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: PIONEER 6\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: PIONEER 6\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: WAVES\n      Short_Name: MUON COSMIC RAY DETECTORS\n      Short_Name: PROBES\n      Short_Name: FLUXGATE MAGNETOMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-08-20\n   Online_Resource: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Alpha&Alias=Pioneer%206&Letter=P&Display=ReadMore\n   Sample_Image: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/images/miss-pioneer_06.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1965-12-16\n      Design_Life: 6 months\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Its primary objective is to study the dynamics of the\nEarth's magnetotail over a wide range of distance, extending from the\nnear-Earth region (8 Earth radii (Re) from the Earth) to the distant tail\n(about 200 Re). The GEOTAIL spacecraft was designed and built by ISAS and was\nlaunched on July 24, 1992.\n\nThe Geotail mission measures global energy flow and transformation in the\nmagnetotail to increase understanding of fundamental magnetospheric processes.\nThis will include the physics of the magnetopause, the plasma sheet, and\nreconnection and neutral line formation (i.e., the mechanisms of input,\ntransport, storage, release and conversion of energy in the magnetotail).\nGeotail, together with Wind, Polar, SOHO, and Cluster projects, constitute a\ncooperative scientific satellite project designated the International\nSolar-Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) program which aims at gaining improved\nunderstanding of the physics of solar terrestrial relations.\n\nGeotail is a spin-stabilized spacecraft utilizing mechanically despun antennas\nwith a design lifetime of about four years. The nominal spin rate of the\nspacecraft is about 20 rpm around a spin axis maintained between 85 and 89 deg\nto the ecliptic plane. Geotail is cylindrical, approximately 2.2 m in diameter\nand 1.6 m high with body-mounted solar cells. Geotail also has a two-hour\nback-up battery subsystem which operates when the spacecraft is in the Earth's\nshadow.\n\nReal-time telemetry data transmitted in the X-band are received at the Usuda\nDeep Space Center (UDSC) in Japan. There are two tape recorders on board, each\nwith a capacity of 450 Mbit which allow daily 24-hour data coverage. The data\nare collected in playback mode by the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).\n\nThe Geotail mission is divided into two phases. During the two-year initial\nphase, the orbit apogee was kept on the nightside of the Earth by using the\nMoon's gravity in a series of double-lunar swing-by maneuvers that result in\nthe spacecraft spending most of its time in the distant magnetotail (maximum\napogee about 200 Earth radii) with a period varying from one to four months.\nThen, starting in November 1994, there were a series of maneuvers to bring the\nspacecraft into its near-Earth orbit. This transition orbit lasted about three\nmonths with the apogee varying from 50 RE to 30 RE. The second phase is\ndedicated to the study of near-Earth magnetospheric processes, including\nneutral line formation.\n\nThe GEOTAIL mission consists of the following experiments:\n- Comprehensive Plasma Investigation (CPI)\n- Electric Fields Detector (EFD)\n- Energetic Particle and Ion Composition (EPIC)\n- High-Energy Particles (HEP)\n- Low-Energy Particles (LEP)\n- Magnetic Field Experiment\n- Plasma Waves Investigation (PWI)\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/geotail.shtml\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GEOTAIL\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: GEOTAIL\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: GGS/Geotail\n      Short_Name: GTL\n      Short_Name: Geomagnetic Tail Lab\n      Short_Name: ISTP/Geotail\n      Short_Name: 22049\n      Short_Name: 1992-044A\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MFE\n      Short_Name: PWI\n      Short_Name: LEP\n      Short_Name: HEP\n      Short_Name: EPIC\n      Short_Name: EFD\n      Short_Name: CPI-G\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Inclination: 5.15 degrees - 7.45 degrees\n      Period: 43 days - 49 days\n      Perigee: 47,835 km - 51,024 km\n      Apogee: 869,421 km - 191,340 km\n      Orbit_Type: HEO > Highly Elliptical Orbit\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/geotail.shtml\n   Online_Resource: http://www.stp.isas.ac.jp/geotail/\n   Sample_Image: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/spacecraft/geotail.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1992-07-24\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: ISAS, Japan\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Supermassive black holes, merging neutron stars, streams of hot gas moving close to the speed of light ... these are but a few of the marvels that generate gamma-ray radiation, the most energetic form of radiation, billions of times more energetic than the type of light visible to our eyes. What is happening to produce this much energy? What happens to the surrounding environment near these phenomena? How will studying these energetic objects add to our understanding of the very nature of the Universe and how it behaves?\n\nThe Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, formerly GLAST, will open this high-energy world to exploration and help us to answer these questions. With Fermi, astronomers will at long last have a superior tool to study how black holes, notorious for pulling matter in, can accelerate jets of gas outward at fantastic speeds. Physicists will be able to study subatomic particles at energies far greater than those seen in ground-based particle accelerators. And cosmologists will gain valuable information about the birth and early evolution of the Universe.\n\nFor this unique endeavor, one that brings together the astrophysics and particle physics communities, NASA is teaming up with the U.S. Department of Energy and institutions in France, Germany, Japan, Italy and Sweden. General Dynamics was chosen to build the spacecraft. Fermi was launched June 11, 2008 at 12:05 pm EDT.\nMission Objectives\n\n - Explore the most extreme environments in the Universe, where nature harnesses energies far beyond anything possible on Earth.\n - Search for signs of new laws of physics and what composes the mysterious Dark Matter.\n - Explain how black holes accelerate immense jets of material to nearly light speed.\n - Help crack the mysteries of the stupendously powerful explosions known as gamma-ray bursts.\n - Answer long-standing questions across a broad range of topics, including solar flares, pulsars and the origin of cosmic rays.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: FERMI\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: FERMI\n      Long_Name: Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: GLAST\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: LAT\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2009-09-14\n   Online_Resource: http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/main/index.html\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/glast\n   Sample_Image: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/glast/graphic\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2008-06-11\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

                                        "description": "[Source: NASA Science Mission Directorate Home Page, https://science.nasa.gov/ ]\n\n[SDO was successfully launched on 2010-02-11.  Please follow the SDO home page for mission updates. https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/  ] \n\nThe Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is the first mission to be launched for NASA's Living With a Star (LWS) Program, a program designed to understand the causes of solar variability and its impacts on Earth. SDO is designed to help us understand study the Sun's influence on Earth and Near-Earth space by studying observing the solar atmosphere on small scales of space and time and in many wavelengths simultaneously.\n\nSDO's goal is to understand, driving towards a predictive capability, the solar variations that influence life on Earth and humanity's technological systems by determining how the Sun's magnetic field is generated and structured how this stored magnetic energy is converted and released into the heliosphere and geospace in the form of solar wind, energetic particles, and variations in the solar irradiance. SDO data will help us to understand the cause the how and why of the Sun's magnetic activity changes. It will determine how the magnetic field is generated and structured, and how the stored magnetic energy is released into the heliosphere and geospace. SDO data and analysis will also help us develop the ability to predict the solar activity variations. that influence life on Earth and humanity's technological systems.\n\nSDO will observe different layers in solar atmosphere from visible surface, photosphere, to outer corona. measure the properties of the Sun and solar activity. There are few types of measurements but many of them will be taken. For example, Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) will record maps of magnetic fields on entire visible solar hemisphere. HMI will also observe flows of plasma in the photosphere. These observations will be used to study motions throughout solar atmosphere: from the global scale (solar rotation), to small spatial scales (e.g. convective motions, which the surface velocity is measured by HMI. This data can be used for many different studies. One is the surface rotation rate, which must be removed to study the others. After subtracting the rotation, you have the oscillation and convective velocities. The latter look like billows of storm clouds covering the Sun. Hot gas moves outward at the center of the billows and downward at the edges\u2014just like boiling water). Data from HMI will also allow us to study processes taking place underneath the visible surface. These studies will be conducted using methods of helioseismology, in the same manner as geologies on Earth study interior of our planet. Other SDO instruments,  Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) will study hot outer layers of solar atmosphere, corona. AIA will take images and movies of corona in several wavelengths of ultraviolet light. The third SDO instrument, ), Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE)  will observe total every flux from the Sun, or irradiance. The variations in irradiance are important component of Earth's atmosphere and climate models. \n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: SDO\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: Living with a Star\n      Short_Name: SDO\n      Long_Name: Solar Dynamics Observatory\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: SDO\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: HMI-SDO\n      Short_Name: AIA-SDO\n      Short_Name: EVE-SDO\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 36,000 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 28.5 degrees\n      Orbit_Type: GEO > Geosynchronous > Non-Geostationary\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2009-04-24\n   Online_Resource: https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sdo/main/index.html\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2010-02-11\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Design_Life: 5 years 3 months\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The spacecraft spin axis was perpendicular to the\necliptic plane with a spin rate of 5 rpm, giving it a spin period of\n12 seconds.  IMP-6 continued the study, begun by earlier IMPs, of the\ninterplanetary and outer magnetospheric regions by measuring energetic\nparticles, plasma, and electric and magnetic fields.  A radio astronomy\nexperiment was also included in the spacecraft payload.  The initial\napogee point was near the earth-sun line.  The solar-cell and chemical-\nbattery powered spacecraft carried two transmitters.  One continuously\ntransmitted PCM encoder data at a 1600-bps information bit rate.  The\nsecond transmitter was used for transmission of VLF data and for ranging\ninformation.  Three orthogonal pairs of dipole antennas were used for\nthe electric fields experiments, and one of these pairs was also used\nfor the radio astronomy experiment.  The members of the antenna pair\nalong the spacecraft spin axis extended 2.9 meter, the members of the\nantennal pair used in both the electric field and radio astronomy\nexperiments extended 45.5 meter, and the members of the third pair were\nslightly unbalanced, extending 24.4 meter and 27.6 meter, respectively.\nAll four elements perpendicular to the spin axis were to have extended\n45.5 meter.  The spacecraft reentered the earth's atmosphere on October 2,\n1974, after a highly successful mission.

At lesser altitudes energy is\ntransferred from electric fields and electromagnetic waves to electrons that\nthen plunge into the atmosphere to create the aurora. At mid-altitudes nearer\nthe equator the satellite passes through the Earth's trapped radiation, the Van\nAllen belts. Out of the polar ionosphere flows plasma to populate the\nmagnetosphere. Through this region particles and energy flow from the\ngeomagnetic tail to the atmosphere. Thus the instruments on the Polar\nsatellites see a lot of action in the various plasma parameters that they\nmeasure.\n\nThree of the twelve scientific instruments aboard the Polar satellite are used\nto image the aurora in various wavelengths when the satellite is near apogee,\nhigh over the northern polar region. The other nine instruments make\nmeasurements in-situ, at the location of the satellite, around the entire\norbit. They measure the fluxes of charged particles, electrons and protons,  as\nwell as heavier ions, from thermal energies into MeV energies. They measure\nmagnetic and electric fields, plus electromagnetic waves. They must make these\nmeasurements in great detail in order for scientists to be able to learn new\nthings about the environment in the region over the poles of the Earth.\n\nThe Polar satellite is in a highly elliptical orbit, with apogee at 9 earth\nradii and perigee at 1.8 earth radii geocentric. The inclination is 86 deg. and\nthe period about 18 hours. Initially apogee was over the northern polar region,\nbut apogee has been moving towards the equator at about 16 deg. per year.  The\nnominal mission duration was two years, but a three year extended  mission has\nbeen approved.  \n\nDetails on the POLAR mission and instrumentation are provided in Space Science\nReviews (Vol. 71, Nos. 1-4, 1995) and reprinted in The Global Geospace Mission,\nedited by C.

Named the Gravity and Extreme Magnetism Small Explorer (GEMS), the satellite will be the first to systematically measure the polarization of cosmic X-ray sources.\n\n\"To date, astronomers have measured X-ray polarization from only a single object outside the solar system -- the famous Crab Nebula, the luminous cloud that marks the site of an exploded star,\" said Jean Swank, a Goddard astrophysicist and the GEMS principal investigator. \u201cWe expect that GEMS will detect dozens of sources and really open up this new frontier.\"\n\nGoddard will provide the X-ray mirrors and polarimeter instrument for GEMS and oversee the mission's science operations center, science data processing and systems engineering.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation -- light, radio waves, X-rays -- contains a varying electric field. Polarization refers to this field's direction. An everyday example of putting polarization to use is as close as a pair of sunglasses. Reflected light contains an electric field with a specific orientation. Because polarized sunglasses block light vibrating in this direction, they can reduce the glare of reflected sunlight.\n\nThe extreme gravitational field near a spinning black hole not only bends the paths of X-rays, it also alters the directions of their electric fields. Polarization measurements can reveal the presence of a black hole and provide astronomers with information on its spin. Fast-moving electrons emit polarized X-rays as they spiral through intense magnetic fields, providing GEMS with the means to explore another aspect of extreme environments.\n\n\"Thanks to these effects, GEMS can probe spatial scales far smaller than any telescope can possibly image,\" Swank said. Polarized X-rays carry information about the structure of cosmic sources that isn't available in any other way.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: GEMS\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: NASA Small Explorer (SMEX)\n      Short_Name: GEMS\n      Long_Name: Gravity and Extreme Magnetism Small Explorer\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2009-08-11\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2009/gems_explore.html\n   Online_Resource: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/gems/\n   Online_Resource: http://explorers.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Sample_Image: http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/images/content/376204main_GEMS_labeled_226.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2014-07-01\n      Design_Life: 2 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The primary purpose of ACE is to determine and\ncompare the isotopic and elemental composition of several distinct\nsamples of matter, including the solar corona, the interplanetary\nmedium, the local interstellar medium, and Galactic matter.\nThe spacecraft is 1.6 meters across and 1 meter high, not including\nthe four solar arrays and the magnetometer booms attached to two of\nthe solar panels. It will weigh 785 kg, which includes 189 kg of\nhydrazine fuel for orbit insertion and maintenance. The solar arrays\nwill generate about 500 watts of power at the beginning of life. The\nspacecraft will spin at 5 rpm, with the spin axis generally pointed\nalong the Earth-sun line and most of the scientific instruments on the\ntop (sunward) deck.  The instruments that are carried on ACE are as follows:\nCosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer (CRIS), Electon,Proton,and Alpha Monitor\n(EPAM), Magnetometer (MAG), Solar Energetic Particle Ionic Charge Analyzer\n(SEPICA), Solar Isotope Spectrometer (SIS), Solar Wind Electon, Proton, and\nAlpha Monitor (SWEPAM), Solar Wind Ionic Charge Spectrometer (SWICS),\nSolar Wind Ion Mass Spectrometer (SWIMS), and Ultra Low Energy Isotope\nSpectrometer (ULEIS).\n\nACE launched on a McDonnell-Douglas Delta II 7920 launch vehicle on\nAugust 25, 1997 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\nIn order to get away from the effects of the Earth's magnetic field,\nthe ACE spacecraft has travelled almost a million miles (1.5 million\nkm) from the Earth to the Earth-sun libration point (L1). By orbiting\nthe L1 point, ACE will stay in a relatively constant position with\nrespect to the Earth as the Earth revolves around the sun.\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: ACE\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: ACE\n      Long_Name: Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Explorer 71\n      Short_Name: 1997-045A\n      Short_Name: 24912\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: MAG\n      Short_Name: SWICS\n      Short_Name: SEPICA\n      Short_Name: SIS\n      Short_Name: SWEPAM\n      Short_Name: EPAM\n      Short_Name: SWIMS\n      Short_Name: ULEIS\n      Short_Name: CRIS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 1.5 million km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 28.7 degrees\n      Perigee: 179 km\n      Apogee: 1256768 km\n      Orbit_Type: LPO > L1 > Lissajous Orbit > Halo Orbit\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-14\n   Online_Resource: http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/\n   Online_Resource: http://sd-www.jhuapl.edu/ACE/ACE_FactSheet.html\n   Sample_Image: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/spacecraft/ace1.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1997-08-25\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n      Primary_Sponsor: California Institute of Technology\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

The only instrument on board is an imaging spectrometer with\nthe ability to obtain high fidelity color movies of solar flares in X rays and\ngamma rays. It uses two new complementary technologies: fine grids to modulate\nthe solar radiation, and germanium detectors to measure the energy of each\nphoton very precisely. The HESSI was renamed the Reuven Ramaty High Energy\nSolar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). RHESSI is a NASA Small Explorer satellite\nand was launched February 5, 2002.\n\nRHESSI's imaging capability is achieved with fine tungsten and/or molybdenum\ngrids that modulate the solar X-ray flux as the spacecraft rotates at ~ 15 rpm.\nUp to 20 detailed images can be obtained per second. This is sufficient to\ntrack the electrons as they travel from their acceleration site, believed to be\nin the solar corona, and slow down on their way to the lower solar atmosphere.\n\nThe high-resolution spectroscopy is achieved with 9 cooled germanium crystals\nthat detect the X-ray and gamma-ray photons transmitted through the grids over\nthe broad energy range of 3 keV to 20 MeV. Their fine energy resolution of\nabout 1 keV is more than sufficient to reveal the detailed features of the\nX-ray and gamma-ray spectra, clues to the nature of the electron and ion\nacceleration processes. \n\nFor more information, see;\nhttp://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/hessi/index.html\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: RHESSI\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: RHESSI\n      Long_Name: Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: HESSI\n      Short_Name: Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager\n      Short_Name: SMEX/RHESSI\n      Short_Name: Small Explorer/RHESSI\n      Short_Name: 27370\n      Short_Name: 2002-004A\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: HESSI SPECTROMETER\n      Short_Name: HESSI IMAGER\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 600 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 38 degrees\n      Period: 96.5 m\n      Perigee: 579 km\n      Apogee: 607 km\n      Orbit_Type: LEO > Low Earth Orbit > Polar Sun-Synchronous\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/hessi/\n   Sample_Image: http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/hessi/images/hessicraft.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2002-02-05\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Design_Life: 2 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA/GSFC\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

Specifically, the spacecraft's instruments were designed to investigate phenomena such as solar wind, magnetic and electric fields, cosmic rays, and cosmic dust in regions between Earth's orbit and approximately 0.3 AU from the Sun. \n\nIt was the largest bilateral project to date for NASA, with Germany paying about $180 million of the total $260-million cost. Germany provided the spacecraft and NASA the launch vehicles. \n\nAfter a successful launch, Helios 1 passed within 47 million kilometers of the Sun at a speed of 238,000 kilometers per hour on 15 March 1975, the closest any humanmade object had been to our nearest star. During its mission, the spacecraft spun once every second to evenly distribute the heat coming from the Sun, 90 percent of which was reflected by optical surface mirrors. Its data indicated the presence of fifteen times more micrometeorites close to the Sun than there are near Earth. \n\nInformation provided by http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&Target=Sun&MCode=Helios_01&Display=ReadMore\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: HELIOS 1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: HELIOS 1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: Helio 1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: WAVES\n      Short_Name: 3DP\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-08-13\n   Online_Resource: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&Target=Sun&MCode=Helios_01&Display=ReadMore\n   Sample_Image: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/images/miss-helios_01.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1974-11-10\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

                                "description": "The HESSI mission consists of a single spin-stabilized spacecraft in a low-altitude orbit inclined 38 degrees to the Earth's equator. The only instrument on board is an imaging spectrometer with the ability to obtain high fidelity color movies of solar flares in X rays and gamma rays. It uses two new complementary technologies: fine grids to modulate the solar radiation, and germanium detectors to measure the energy of each photon very precisely. \n\nHESSI's imaging capability is achieved with fine tungsten and/or molybdenum grids that modulate the solar X-ray flux as the spacecraft rotates at ~ 15 rpm. Up to 20 detailed images can be obtained per second. This is sufficient to track the electrons as they travel from their acceleration site, believed to be in the solar corona, and slow down on their way to the lower solar atmosphere. \n\nThe high-resolution spectroscopy is achieved with 9 cooled germanium crystals that detect the X-ray and gamma-ray photons transmitted through the grids over the broad energy range of 3 keV to 20 MeV. Their fine energy resolution of about 1 keV is more than sufficient to reveal the detailed features of the X-ray and gamma-ray spectra, clues to the nature of the electron and ion acceleration processes. \n\nA spinning spacecraft pointing at or near Sun center provides a simple and reliable way to achieve the rotation required for the HESSI imaging technique. A low-altitude equatorial orbit that can be reached with a Pegasus launch vehicle is chosen to minimize damage to the germanium detectors from the charged particles in the Earth's radiation belts. \n\nContext observations from ground-based observatories and a theory program are also integral parts of the HESSI mission. Ground-based optical and radio telescopes will provide complementary data on the magnetic fields, electric currents, hot plasma, and the energetic electrons in the flaring regions where the X-ray and gamma-ray emissions are generated. Also, it is hoped that other spacecraft will provide additional simultaneous observations of the thermal and dynamic environment to further enhance our knowledge of the conditions in the flaring region. \n\n[Information provided by NASA.]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: HESSI\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Short_Name: HESSI\n      Long_Name: High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: HESSI\n   End_Group\n   Group: Platform_Associated_Instruments\n      Short_Name: POLARIMETERS\n      Short_Name: SPECTROGRAPHS\n      Short_Name: WAVES\n      Short_Name: VECTOR MAGNETOGRAPHS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Orbit\n      Orbit_Altitude: 600 km\n      Orbit_Inclination: 38 degrees\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-08-13\n   Online_Resource: http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/hessi/\n   Sample_Image: http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/hessi/images/hessicraft.gif\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 2002-02-05\n      Launch_Site: Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center, USA\n      Design_Life: 2 years\n      Primary_Sponsor: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

OSO-1 was launched\non March 7, 1962 to study the sun in the ultraviolet, x-ray and\ngamma-ray regions of the spectrum. Sun sensors connected to\nservo-feedback systems on the upper \"sail\" portion were\ndesigned to keep the pointed instruments (75 pound payload) to\nwithin +/- 1 minute of arc on the center of the sun. The lower\nspinning portion carried some 100 pounds of instruments and\nrotated once every two seconds, allowing those instruments to\nscan the solar disk and atmosphere. The OSO had three\nprotruding arms that extended after deployment which gave the\nsystem greater axial stability. Among many observations by the\nbattery of instruments on OSO was that the sun's corona had\nopenings, now called coronal holes, which were interpreted as\nhuge fast-moving bubbles rising through the corona. Ball\nAerospace Systems Division restored the OSO-I engineering\nprototype in 1982 af ter it was transferred from NASA in 1981.\n\nFor additional information, link to\n\"http://www.nasm.si.edu/nasm/dsh/artifacts/SS-OSO1.htm\"\n\n[Summary provided by the Smithsonian, National Air and Space Museum]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: SOLRAD-1\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Solar/Space Observation Satellites\n      Platform_Series_or_Entity: SOLRAD\n      Short_Name: SOLRAD-1\n      Long_Name: Solar Radiation-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Synonymous_Platform_Names\n      Short_Name: solrad-1\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2007-01-14\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasm.si.edu/nasm/dsh/artifacts/SS-OSO1.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://www.weltraumforschung.de/Images/solrad1.jpg\n   Group: Platform_Logistics\n      Launch_Date: 1962-03-07\n      Primary_Sponsor: United States Department of Defense\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group",

It was placed into lunar orbit on June 15, 1973,\n  to  provide  radio  astronomical measurements of the planets, the sun,\n  and  the  galaxy  over the frequency range of 25 kHz to 13.1 MHz.  The\n  experiment  complement consisted of two Ryle-Vonberg radiometers (nine\n  channels  each),  three  swept-frequency  burst receivers (32 channels\n  each),  and  an  impedance  probe  for  calibration.   The  experiment\n  antennas  consisted  of  a 229-m upper V-antenna pointed away from the\n  moon;  a  183-m  lower  V-antenna  pointed toward the moon; and a 37-m\n  dipole antenna parallel to the lunar surface.  The lower V-antenna was\n  extended  to  its  full 229-m length in November 1974.  The spacecraft\n  body  was a truncated cylinder 36.25 in. in diameter and approximately\n  31-in.  high,  with  four fixed solar paddles.  The maneuvering system\n  consisted  of  a  hydrazine  velocity  correction  package, a cold gas\n  attitude control system, and a solid fuel lunar insertion motor.  Data\n  were  returned  to  the  earth  via  either  a low power UHF/(400 MHz)\n  transmitter,  in  real time, or stored in an onboard tape recorder and\n  transmitted  to  earth via a high power UHF transmitter (400 MHz). Two\n  tape  recorders  provided  backup  storage.   A VHF transmitter served\n  primarily  for  range  and  range-rate  measurements  and as a backup.\n  Commands  were  received on a VHF (148 MHz) receiver, which also was a\n  part  of  the  range  and  range-rate  system. Spacecraft attitude was\n  determined  by (1) a solar aspect system, (2) a horizon sensor system,\n  and (3) a panoramic attitude sensor system, and was accurate to 1 deg.\n  The spacecraft was gravity gradient oriented (Z axis parallel to local\n  vertical)  and  was  equipped  with  libration  dampers  to  damp  out\n  oscillations.

Data were obtained on the storage and\nrelease of flare energy, particle acceleration, formation of hot\nplasma, and mass ejection. Complementary studies were made as part of\nthe SMM guest investigator program, and coordinated in-situ\nmeasurements of flare particle emissions were made from the ISEE-3\nspacecraft.\n\nThe SMM observatory was of modular construction and measured\napproximately 4 m in length, fitting into a circular envelope 2.3 m in\ndiameter. The instrument module occupied the top 2.3 m and contained\nall the solar payload instruments together with the fine-pointing\nSun-sensor system. Below the instrument module was the Multimission\nModular Spacecraft (MMS) containing the systems for attitude control,\npower, communication, and data handling. Between the instrument module\nand the MMS was the transition adaptor, supporting two fixed solar\npaddles that supplied between 1500 and 3000 W of power.\nQuick and coordinated responses to solar flares were considered\nessential for meeting the scientific objectives of the\nmission. Therefore, the ground system was designed to facilitate\ncoordinated data evaluation, observation, planning, and command uplink\nto the onboard stored command processor. Onboard coordination of\nresponse to a flare was performed in real time. The attitude-control\nsoftware allowed observatory repointings and slow scanning motions;\nthere was also a special module for tracking a solar feature over many\ndays.\n\nA repair mission by the space shuttle (STS-41C) was performed in\n1984. During the repair mission the Shuttle astronauts rendezvoused\nwith SMM and replaced successfully some hardware. As a result the\ncoronagraph observations resumed until the end of mission.\nSMM collected data until Nov. 24, 1989, and re-entered on Dec. 2, 1989.\n\nFor more details, see\nE. G. Chipman, Ap.

The present complement of instruments allows for the determination of carbon dioxide, ozone, water vapor, and methane concentrations as well as measurements of three-dimensional wind speeds, temperature, and pressure. Planned future instrumentation includes an Air-Core sampler and an instrument to measure formaldehyde. We give examples of measurements that have been made, including measurements carried out during a downward spiral over an expected methane source. An attractive property of this airborne system is its ability to respond rapidly to unexpected atmospheric events such as large forest fires or severe air quality events.",

Development started in 1952 and prototypes were ordered the next year. The first prototypes flew in 1955 and construction and testing continued until 1958 when an order for 100 was placed. This was reversed soon after due to a crash of the third prototype. Two additional prototypes were finished, the last in 1960, but the project was ended at this point.\n\nThe basic structure of this aircraft was seen by Bill Lear and his team as a good starting point to the development of a business jet, which was originally intended to be called the SAAC-23. The wing with its distinctive tip fuel tanks and landing gear of the first Learjets were little changed from those used by the fighter prototypes. The tooling for building the aircraft was purchased and moved to Wichita, Kansas in 1962. On February 7, assembly of the first Learjet began. The next year, the company was renamed the Lear Jet Corporation.\n\n[Text provided by: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learjet ]\n\n[Photo provided by: http://www.aerospace-technology.com ]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: LEARJET\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Aircraft\n      Short_Name: LEARJET\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-14\n   Online_Resource: http://www.learjet.com/\n   Online_Resource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learjet\n   Sample_Image: http://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/learjet/images/Learjet45_2.jpg\nEnd_Group",

The turbofan engines provide sufficient power to cruise at speeds of up to 340 knots (175 m s-1) or climb at 3300 feet per minute (16.8 m s-1). These high performance capabilities are accompanied by relatively low fuel consumption at all altitudes, giving the Citation an on-station time of 3-5 hours, depending on mission type. Long wings allow it to be operated out of relatively short airstrips and to be flown at the slower speeds (140 kts/72 m s-1) necessary for many types of measurements.

It provides similar passenger capacity to a 747 but with 25% more cargo volume, and at lower trip and seat costs. First flight of the A340-600 was made on 23 April 2001. Virgin Atlantic began commercial services in August 2002.\n\nThe A340-600 is more than 10 m longer than a basic -300, making it the longest airliner currently in production; more than four metres longer than the Boeing 747-400. The Airbus A340-600 will continue to hold the record for being the worlds longest commercial aircraft until the first Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental is rolled out in 2010. It is powered by four 56,000 lbf (249 kN) thrust Rolls-Royce Trent 556 turbofans. It also has an additional four-wheel undercarriage on the fuselage center-line to cope with the increased MTOW. Airbus has made provisions for freeing additional upper deck main cabin space, by providing optional arrangements for additional facilities such as crew rest areas, galleys, and lavatories upon the \"stretched\" A340 aircraft's lower decks.",

This handy twin-jet utility plane has been used for many purposes: a four-passenger executive transport, light priority cargo and for radar and navigational training. The T-39 Sabreliner is a low wing, twin jet aircraft. The cockpit and cabin compartments are pressurized and soundproofed for high altitude flight. Power is supplied by two Pratt and Whitney, J60 gas turbine engines located on each side of the aft fuselage. The rated sea level static thrust of each engine is 3,000 pounds at military power.\n\nThe T-39 was developed by North American Aviation Inc. as a private venture to meet a USAF requirement for a twin jet utility trainer. The prototype T-39 made its first flight on September 16, 1958. In January 1959, the USAF placed a production order and on June 30, 1960, the first production T-39A made its initial flight. In all, 143 T-39As and 6 T-39Bs were built for the USAF.\n\nAnother 62 T-39 variants were produced for the Navy. In July 1961, the Navy ordered ten of North American\u2019s Model NA-277 to train radar operators. In that order the aircraft was designated T3J-1, but by the time the first one was delivered in 1962, the designation had been changed to T-39D. A total of 52 additional aircraft were accepted. After the bulk of military contracts had been met, the Sabreliner entered the commercial market where it became a highly successful executive jet transport.",

It's rugged, fast and powerful, but its fighting days are numbered.\n\nThough the United States Navy is slowly decommissioning the fleet, one S-3B is still flying in hostile conditions. Its next mission? Venture into hazardous weather to study a phenomenon that has caused more than 100 commercial aircraft engines to fail, stall or temporarily lose power.\n\nEngineers from NASA's Glenn Research Center, Boeing and the Navy have combined forces to transform the S-3B into a state-of-the-art NASA research aircraft. Last month, NASA Glenn unveiled the modified plane in Cleveland.\n\n\"We were able to capitalize on the decommissioning by acquiring the aircraft directly from the Navy,\" explained Dr. Rickey Shyne, director of Glenn's Facilities and Test Directorate. \"This saved taxpayers millions of dollars compared to the cost of a new aircraft.\"\n\nWorkers at the Navy's Fleet Readiness Center - Southeast and a Boeing facility in Fla. enhanced the plane by adding commercial satellite communications, global positioning navigation and weather radar systems. They installed research equipment racks in what was once the plane's bomb bay. And they gave it a shiny blue-and-white NASA paint job.\n\nWith these new features, NASA's S-3B Viking is equipped to conduct science and aeronautics missions, such as environmental monitoring, satellite communications testing and aviation safety research. It can fly up to 40,000 feet high and reach speeds faster than 500 miles per hour, which makes it perfect for studying commercial airline safety issues.",

The prototype was then named the PA-21 to conform to Piper's numerical nomenclature[1] It was redesigned with a single vertical stabilizer and an all-metal rear fuselage and renamed to Apache 150 when it entered production in 1954; 1,231 were built. In 1958, the Apache 160 was produced by upgrading the engines to 160 hp (119 kW), and 816 were built before being superseded by the Apache 235, which went to 235 hp (175 kW) engines and swept tail surfaces (119 built).\n\nDeclining sales of the Apache prompted the redesign dubbed PA-23-250 Aztec, with 250 hp (186 kW) Lycoming. The first models were delivered with O-540 Lycoming carburetor engines. These first models came in a five-seat configuration which became available in 1959. The later models of the Aztec were equipped with IO-540 fuel-injected engines and six-seat capacity, and continued in production until 1982. There were also turbocharged versions of the later models, which were able to fly at higher altitudes.",

                                "description": "The Fokker F27 Friendship is a turboprop airliner designed and built by the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker.\n\nDesign of the Fokker F27 started in the 1950s as a replacement to the successful DC-3 airliner. The manufacturer evaluated a number of different configurations before finally deciding on a high wing twin Rolls-Royce Dart engine layout with a pressurised cabin for 28 passengers.\n\nThe first prototype, registered PH-NIV, first flew on 24 November 1955. The second prototype and initial production machines were 3 ft (0.9 m) longer, addressing the first aircraft's slightly tail-heavy handling and also providing space for more (32) passengers. These aircraft also used the more powerful Dart Mk 528 engine. The first production model, the F27-100, was delivered to Aer Lingus in September 1958.\n\nIn 1956 Fokker signed a licensing deal with the US aircraft manufacturer Fairchild for the latter to construct the F27 in the USA. The first U.S.-built aircraft flew on 12 April 1958. Fairchild also independently developed a stretched version, called the FH-227.\n\nAt the end of the Fokker F27s production in 1987, 793 units had been built (including 207 in the USA by Fairchild), which makes it the most successful western European civil turboprop airliner.\n\nMany aircraft have been modified from passenger service to cargo or express-package freighter roles.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Fokker developed a successor to the Friendship, the Fokker 50. Although based on the F27-500 airframe, the Fokker 50 is virtually a new aircraft with Pratt & Whitney Canada engines and modern systems. Its general performance and passenger comfort were improved over the F27.",

Instead of building a new plane, Convair decided that those very Convair-Liners could be re-engined instead.  An experimental installation of Allison T56 engines into a CV-240 in 1950 was quite successful, but the first commercial conversion did not take place until 1954, and then with British Napier Elands. \n\n[Text provided by: http://www.calclassic.com/580.htm ]\n\n[Photo provided by: http://images3.jetphotos.net/ ]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: CONVAIR CV-580\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Aircraft\n      Short_Name: CONVAIR CV-580\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-14\n   Online_Resource: http://www.calclassic.com/580.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://images3.jetphotos.net/img/2/4/6/2/79826_1215091264.jpg\nEnd_Group",

The UC-12B aircraft is a military version of a Beechcraft B200 King Air.  NASA Langley acquired this aircraft in 2007 from the U.S. Marine Corps.  The aircraft has been modified with two nadir-viewing ports:  29.5 x 29.5-in. in the forward section of the passenger cabin and 26.75 x 22.5 in. in the aft section.  These downward-looking portals allow the use of a wide variety of optical, laser, or R-F based devices that might require a nadir look angle out of the aircraft.  Research-supporting subsystems, such as electrical power distribution, TCAS, GPS and satellite phone communications also have been installed.  The UC-12B aircraft also has a cargo door in the aft left side of the passenger cabin that can accommodate payloads up to 51.5 in. wide.  In past operations, the cargo door has allowed a forklift with a boom attachment to place large, heavy payloads directly into the aircraft cabin.  In its current configuration, the aircraft serves as the primary flight platform for a suite of aerosol and cloud remote-sensing instruments, including the NASA Langley Doppler Aerosol Wind LIDAR (DAWN).  The aircraft is fully IFR capable.",

They surveyed pilots and operators of other brands of agricultural aircraft to see what features and capabilities these operators were looking for. The resulting aircraft was a conventional single-seat, piston-powered, strut-braced low-winged agricultural airplane.\n\nThe 188 is the only single-engined Cessna design that does not have a high-wing.\n\nThe Cessna 188 borrowed heavily from the Cessna 180, the initial version using the same tail cone and fin structure as well as the same Continental O-470-R 230hp (170kW) powerplant. The 188\u2019s airframe is predominantly built from 2024-T3 aluminum, with the chemical hopper constructed from fibreglass. The fuselage is of semi-monocoque construction and is pressurized on later models (using the dynamic pressure resulting from the aircraft's forward speed) to reduce induction of chemicals into the airframe.\n\nThe Cessna 188 was first flown on 19 February 1965. The aircraft was certified and entered production in February 1966, with 241 aircraft delivered the first year.\n\nThe initial design of the Cessna 188 was so successful that over its 17-year production run the basic airframe remained unchanged. Only the engines and the agricultural products dispensing systems were upgraded, other than some minor changes to the ventilation systems.\n\nA total of 3967 Cessna 188s of all four variants were built during its production run.\n\n[Text and Photo provided by: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_188 ]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: CESSNA 188\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Aircraft\n      Short_Name: CESSNA 188\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-14\n   Online_Resource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_188\n   Online_Resource: http://www.cessna.com/\n   Sample_Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/CessnaA188BAGtruckC-GSWZ.jpg\nEnd_Group",

                                "description": "Lockheed's Electra provided a number of airlines with their introduction to turbine powered aircraft. Today it remains popular with freight operators.\n\nThe Lockheed L-188 Electra was developed to meet a 1954 American Airlines requirement for a domestic short to medium range 75 to 100 seat airliner. In June 1955 American awarded Lockheed an order for 35 such aircraft. Lockheed's design, the L-188, was a low wing, four turboprop powered aircraft. Many other airlines shared American's interest in the L-188, and by the time the first prototype flew on December 6 1957, the order book stood at 144. Service entry was with Eastern Airlines (due to a pilot's strike at American) on January 12 1959.\n\nHowever, any optimism Lockheed felt about a strong sales future would have been short lived, as a number of crashes in 1959 and 1960 (two of which where the aircraft broke up in flight) contributed to a number of order cancellations.\n\nAs an interim measure following the crashes, speed restrictions were imposed on Electras. Investigations uncovered a design defect with the engine mountings where the wing would shake and eventually break up. Lockheed undertook a significant modification program where the nacelles, nacelle mountings and wing structure were strengthened, and the speed restrictions were eventually lifted in 1961. After that the Electra proved reliable and popular in service, but the damage had been done and production wound up in 1961 after 170 had been built.\n\nLockheed built two basic versions of the Electra. The L-188A was the basic production aircraft, and accounted for most Electra sales. The L-188C entered service with KLM in 1959 and had greater fuel capacity and higher weights, and thus improved payload range performance.\n\nThe Electra also forms the basis for the hugely successful P-3 Orion long range maritime surveillance aircraft of which more than 600 have been built.\n\nMost Electras currently in service are configured as freighters. From 1967 Lockheed converted 41 Electras to freighters or convertible freighter/passenger aircraft, fitting a strengthened floor and a large cargo door forward of the wing on the left side. Other companies have also converted Electras to freighters. However, a small number remain in passenger service.",

Deliveries commenced in late 1954.\n\nThe first significant upgrade to the 310 line came with the 310C of 1959, which introduced more powerful 195kW (260hp) IO-470-D engines. The 310D of 1960 featured swept back vertical tail surfaces. An extra cabin window was added with the 310F. A development of the 310F was the turbocharged 320 Skyknight, with TSIO-470-B engines and a fourth cabin side-window. The Skyknight was in production between 1961 and 1969 (the 320D, E and F were named Executive Skyknight), when it was replaced by the similar Turbo 310.\n\nThe 310G introduced the 'stabila-tip' tip tanks, while the 310K replaced the rear two windows on each side with a single unit. Subsequent significant developments include the 310Q and turbocharged T310Q with redesigned rear cabin with a skylight window, and the final 310R and T310R, identifiable for their lengthened noses. Production ended in 1980.\n\nUSAF military versions were the L-27A (310A) and L-27B (310M) Blue Canoe, later redesignated U-3A and U-3B. \n\n[Text provided by: http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/stats.main?id=149 ]\n\n[Photo provided by: http://www.edcoatescollection.com ]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: CESSNA 320\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Aircraft\n      Short_Name: CESSNA 320\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-14\n   Online_Resource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_310\n   Online_Resource: http://www.cessna.com/\n   Sample_Image: http://www.edcoatescollection.com/ac3/Civil%20Planes/Cessna%20320%20Skynight.jpg\nEnd_Group",

Cessna describes the 206 as \"the sport-utility vehicle of the air.\" These airplanes are also used for aerial photography, skydiving and other utility purposes. They can also be equipped with floats, amphibious floats and skis. Alternatively, they can be fitted with luxury appointments for use as a personal air transport.\n\nBetween the start of production in 1962 and 2006 the total Cessna 205, 206 and 207 production has been 8509 aircraft so far.\n\n[Text and Photo provided by: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_206 ]\n\n\nGroup: Platform_Details\n   Entry_ID: CESSNA 206\n   Group: Platform_Identification\n      Platform_Category: Aircraft\n      Short_Name: CESSNA 206\n   End_Group\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-14\n   Online_Resource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_206\n   Online_Resource: http://www.cessna.com/\n   Sample_Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Cessna.206h.stationair2.arp.jpg/800px-Cessna.206h.stationair2.arp.jpg\nEnd_Group",

It is probably the most popular flight training aircraft in the world.\n\nMeasured by its longevity and popularity, the Cessna 172 is the most successful mass produced light aircraft in history. The first production models were delivered in 1956 and they are still in production as of 2008; more than 43,000 have been built.[1] The Skyhawk's main competitors have been the Beechcraft Musketeer and Grumman AA-5 series (neither in production), the Piper Cherokee and, more recently, the Diamond DA40.\n\nThe Cessna 172 started life as a tricycle landing gear upgrade from the taildragger Cessna 170, with a basic level of standard equipment. The first flight of the prototype was in November 1955. The 172 became an overnight sales success and over 1400 were built in 1956, its first full year of production.\n\nEarly 172s were similar in appearance to the 170, with the same straight aft fuselage and tall gear legs, although the 172 had a straight vertical tail while the 170 had a rounded fin and rudder. Later 172 versions incorporated revised landing gear and the sweptback tail which is still in use today.The final aesthetic development in the mid-1960s, was a lowered rear deck that allowed an aft window. Cessna advertised this added rear visibility as \"Omni-Vision\" . This airframe configuration has remained almost unchanged since then, except for updates in avionics and engines, including the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit in 2005. Production had been halted in the mid-1980s, but was resumed in 1996 with the 160 hp (120 kW) Cessna 172R Skyhawk and was supplemented in 1998 by the 180 hp (135 kW) Cessna 172S Skyhawk SP.",

With its engine at first augmented by a single-stage turbocharger, the ALTUS II reached an altitude of 37,000 ft during its first series of development flights at Dryden in August, 1996. In October of that year, the ALTUS II was flown in an Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM-UAV) study in Oklahoma conducted by Sandia National Laboratories for the Department of Energy (DOE). During the course of those flights, the ALTUS II set a single-flight endurance record for remotely operated aircraft of more than 26 hours.\n\nThe ALTUS I, completed in 1997, flew a series of development flights at Dryden that summer. Those test flights saw the craft reach an altitude of 43,500 ft while carrying a simulated 300-lb payload, a record for a remotely operated aircraft powered by a piston engine augmented with a single-stage turbocharger.\n\nAfter major modifications and upgrades, including installation of a two-stage turbocharger in place of its original single-stage unit, a larger fuel tank and additional intercooling capacity, the ALTUS II returned to flight status in the summer of 1998. The goal of its development test flights was to reach one of the major Level 2 performance milestones within NASA's ERAST program: to fly a gasoline-fueled, piston-engine remotely piloted aircraft for several hours at an altitude at or near 60,000 feet. On March 5, 1999, The ALTUS II maintained flight at or above 55,000 feet for three hours, reaching a maximum density altitude of 57,300 feet during the mission.\n\nLater that spring, the ALTUS II flew another series of Atmospheric Radiation Measurement missions conducted by Sandia National Laboratories for the DOE. Hard-to-measure properties of high-level cirrus clouds that may affect global warming were recorded using specially designed instruments while the Altus flew at 50,000 feet altitude off the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i. Clouds both reflect incoming solar energy back to space, and absorb warm longwave radiation from the Earth's surface, keeping that heat in the atmosphere. Data from the study will help scientists better understand how these dual roles of clouds in reflecting and absorbing solar energy work, and build more accurate global climate models.\n\nIn September, 2001, ALTUS II served as the UAV platform for a flight demonstration of remote sensoring and imaging capabilities that could detect hot spots in wildfires and relay that data in near- real time via the Internet to firefighting commanders below. The demonstration, led by NASA Ames Research Center, was flown over GA-ASI's El Mirage development facility in Southern California.\n\nIn the summer of 2002, The Altus II served as the airborne platform for the Altus Cumulus Electrification Study (ACES), led by Dr. Richard Blakeslee of NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The ACES experiment focused on the collection of electrical, magnetic and optical measurements of thunderstorms. Data collected will help scientists understand the development and life cycles of thunderstorms, which in turn may allow meteorologists to more accurately predict when destructive storms may hit.

They have been used in a reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering role since the 1950s, and more challenging roles are envisioned, including combat missions. Since 1964 the Defense Department has developed 11 different UAVs, though due to acquisition and development problems only 3 entered production. The US Navy has studyied the feasibility of operating VTOL UAVs since the early 1960s, the QH-50 Gyrodyne torpedo-delivery drone being an early example. However, high cost and technological immaturity have precluded acquiring and fielding operational VTOL UAV systems.\n\nBy the early 1990s DOD sought UAVs to satisfy surveillance requirements in Close Range, Short Range or Endurance categories. Close Range was defined to be within 50 kilometers, Short Range was defined as within 200 kilometers and Endurance as anything beyond. By the late 1990s, the Close and Short Range categories were combined, and a separate Shipboard category emerged. The current classes of these vehicles are the Tactical UAV and the Endurance category.",

These observed data are transmitted immediately to the ground station by a radio transmitter located within the instrument package. The ascent of a radiosonde provides an indirect measure of the wind speed and direction at various levels throughout the troposphere. Ground based radio direction finding antenna equipment track the motion of the radiosonde during its ascent through the air.

                                "description": "Still quite similar to the Titan III-C on which it was based, the Titan 34D was introduced in 1982 and could incorporate either the Transtage third stage or a new upper stage called an Inertial Upper Stage (IUS). The IUS was a two-stage booster which effectively provided a third and fourth stage that allowed the Titan 34D to carry large military payloads into orbit. Performance of the Titan 34D was also improved by adding a one-half segment to the previous generation of Titan III solid rocket boosters, making a total of five and one-half segments per booster. The two resulting United Technologies solid rocket boosters burned Powered Aluminum/Ammonium Perchlorate solid fuel and could produce a combined thrust of 2,498,000 pounds. The first stage Aerojet engine could produce a thrust of 532,000 pounds. An Aerojet second stage engine could produce a 101,000-pound thrust. Both the first and second stage engines burned Aerozine 50/Nitrogen Tetroxide liquid fuel. The IUS first stage could produce a thrust of 62,000 pounds, while its second stage was capable of producing a 26,000-pound thrust. Both IUS stages were solid-fueled. The Titan 34D was able to carry a 27,500-pound payload to low-Earth orbit or a 4,200-pound payload to geostationary transfer orbit.",

Titan IIID was flown 22 times with KH-9 and KH-11 satellites between 1971 and 1982, all successful launches. It was designed for heavy LEO payloads.\n\nThe Titan IIID first flew on 15 June 1971, launching the first KH-9 satellite. It was retired from service in 1982, and replaced by the uprated Titan 34D. All launches occurred from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base.",
